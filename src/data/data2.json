{"About breast cancer": "Breast cancer is the most common type of cancer in the UK.Most women who get it (8 out of 10) are over 50, but younger women, and in rare cases, men, can also\u00a0get breast cancer.If it's treated early enough, breast cancer can be prevented from spreading to other parts of the body.The breastsThe breasts are made up of fat, connective tissue and thousands of tiny glands called lobules, which produce milk. When a woman has a baby, the milk is delivered to the nipple through tiny tubes called ducts, which allow her to breastfeed.The body is made up of billions of tiny cells, which usually grow and multiply in an orderly way. New cells are only produced when and where they're needed. In cancer, this orderly process goes wrong and cells begin to grow and multiply uncontrollably.Read more about the causes of breast cancerSymptoms of breast cancerBreast cancer can have a number of symptoms, but the first noticeable symptom is usually a lump or area of thickened breast tissue.Most breast lumps aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor. You should also speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:\na change in the size or shape of one or both breasts\ndischarge from either of your nipples\u00a0(which may be streaked with blood)\na lump or swelling in either of your armpits\ndimpling on the skin of your breasts\na rash on or around your nipple\na change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast\nBreast pain alone isn't a symptom of breast cancer.Learn more about the symptoms of breast cancerAfter examining your breasts, your GP may refer you to a specialist breast cancer clinic for further tests.\u00a0This might include a mammography (breast screening)\u00a0or a biopsy.Read more about\u00a0breast screening\u00a0and\u00a0how breast cancer is diagnosedTypes of breast cancerThere are several different types of breast cancer, which can develop in different parts of the breast. Breast cancer is often divided into non-invasive and invasive types.Non-invasive breast cancer is also known as cancer or carcinoma in situ. This cancer is found in the ducts of the breast and hasn't developed the ability to spread outside the breast.This form of cancer rarely shows as a lump in the breast that can be felt, and is usually found on a mammogram. The most common type of non-invasive cancer is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Invasive cancer has the ability to spread outside the breast, although this doesn't necessarily mean it has spread.The most common form of breast cancer is invasive ductal breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the breast ducts. Invasive ductal breast cancer accounts for about 80% of all\u00a0breast cancer cases and is sometimes called 'no special type'.Other less common types of breast cancer include invasive lobular breast cancer, which develops in the cells that line the milk-producing lobules, inflammatory breast cancer and Paget's disease of the breast.It's possible for breast cancer to spread to other parts of the body, usually through the lymph nodes (small glands that filter bacteria from the body) or the bloodstream. If this happens, it's known as 'secondary' or 'metastatic' breast cancer.Breast cancer screeningThere's a good chance of recovery if breast cancer is detected in its early stages. For this reason, it's vital that women check their breasts regularly for any changes and always get any changes examined by their GP.Mammographic screening (where X-ray\u00a0images of the breast are taken) is the best available method of detecting an early breast lesion. However, you should be aware that a mammogram might fail to detect some breast cancers. It might also increase your chances of having extra tests and interventions, including surgery.Women with a higher-than-average risk of developing breast cancer may be offered screening and genetic testing for the condition.As the risk of breast cancer increases with age, all women who are 50\u00a0to 70 years old are invited for breast cancer screening every 3 years.Women over 70 are also entitled to screening and can arrange an appointment through their GP or local screening unit.The NHS is in the process of extending the programme as a trial, offering screening to some women aged 47\u00a0to 73.Read more about\u00a0breast screening and find breast cancer screening services near youTreating breast cancerIf cancer is detected at an early stage, it can be treated before it spreads to nearby parts of the body.Breast cancer is treated using a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Surgery is usually the first type of treatment you'll have, followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments.The type of surgery and the treatment you have afterwards will depend on the type of breast cancer you have. Your doctor will discuss the best treatment plan with you.In a\u00a0small proportion of women, breast cancer is discovered after it's spread to other parts of the body (metastasis). Secondary cancer, also called advanced or metastatic cancer, isn't curable, so the aim of treatment is\u00a0to achieve remission (symptom relief).Read more about treating breast cancerPreventing breast cancerAs the causes of breast cancer aren't fully understood, it's not possible to know if it can be prevented altogether.If you're at increased risk of developing the condition, some treatments are available to reduce the risk.Studies have looked at the link between breast cancer and diet and, although there are no definite conclusions, there are benefits for women who maintain a healthy weight, exercise regularly and who have a low intake of saturated\u00a0fat and alcohol.It's been suggested that regular exercise can reduce your risk of breast cancer by as much as a third. If you've been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because being overweight or obese causes more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.Read more about preventing breast cancerLiving with breast cancerBeing diagnosed with breast cancer can affect daily life in many ways,\u00a0depending on what stage\u00a0it's at and what treatment you're having.How women cope with their diagnosis and treatment varies from person to person. You can be reassured that there are several forms of support available, if you need it. For example:\nyour\u00a0family and\u00a0friends can be a powerful support system\nyou can communicate with other people in the same situation\nfind out as much as possible about your condition\ndon't try to do too much or overexert yourself\nmake time for yourself\nRead more about living with breast cancer", "Symptoms of breast cancer": "The first symptom of breast cancer most women notice is a lump or an area of thickened tissue in their breast.Most\u00a0breast lumps (90%) aren't cancerous, but it's always best to have them checked by your doctor.You should speak to your GP if you notice any of the following:\na lump or area of thickened tissue in either breast\na change in the size or shape of one or both breasts\ndischarge from either of your nipples\u00a0(which may be streaked with blood)\na lump or swelling in either of your armpits\ndimpling on the skin of your breasts\na rash on or around your nipple\na change in the appearance of your nipple, such as becoming sunken into your breast\nBreast pain alone isn't a symptom of breast cancer.Read further information:\nBreast Cancer Now: Changes to look and feel for\nCancer Research UK: Breast cancer symptoms\nMacmillan: What are the symptoms of breast cancer in women?\nBreast awarenessIt's important to be breast aware,\u00a0so you can pick up any changes as soon as possible.

Some of these you can't do anything about, but there are some you can change.AgeThe risk of developing breast cancer increases with age. The condition is most common among women over 50 who have been through the menopause. About 8 out of 10 cases of breast cancer occur in women over 50.All women who are 50\u00a0to 70 years of age should be screened for breast cancer every 3 years as part of the NHS Breast Screening Programme. Women over the age of 70 are still eligible to be screened and can arrange this through their GP or local screening unit.Read more about breast screeningFamily historyIf you have close relatives who have had breast cancer or ovarian cancer, you may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer. However, because breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, it's possible for it to occur in more than one family member by chance.Most cases of breast cancer aren't hereditary (they don't run in families), but particular genes, known as BRCA1 and BRCA2, can increase your risk of developing both breast and ovarian cancer. It's possible for these genes to be passed on from a parent to their child. A third gene (TP53) is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer.If you have, for example, 2 or more close relatives from the same side of your family, such as your mother, sister or daughter, who have had breast cancer under the age of 50, you may be eligible for surveillance for breast cancer or for genetic screening to look for the genes that make developing breast cancer more likely. If you're worried about your family history of breast cancer, discuss it with your GP.Read about predictive genetic tests for cancer risk genesPrevious diagnosis of breast cancerIf you've previously had breast cancer or early non-invasive cancer cell changes in breast ducts, you have a higher risk of developing it again, either in your other breast or in the same breast again.Previous benign breast lumpA\u00a0benign breast lump doesn't mean\u00a0you have breast cancer, but certain types of lump may slightly increase your risk of developing it. Certain benign changes in your breast tissue, such as atypical ductal hyperplasia (cells growing abnormally in ducts), or lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells inside your breast lobes), can make getting breast cancer more likely.Breast densityYour breasts are made up of thousands of tiny glands (lobules), which produce milk. This glandular tissue contains a higher concentration of breast cells than other breast tissue, making it denser. Women with dense breast tissue may have a higher risk of developing breast cancer because there are more cells that can become cancerous.Dense breast tissue can also make a breast scan (mammogram) difficult to read, because it makes any lumps or areas of abnormal tissue harder to spot. Younger women tend to have denser breasts. As you get older, the amount of glandular tissue in your breasts decreases and is replaced by fat, so your breasts become less dense.Exposure to oestrogenThe female hormone, oestrogen,\u00a0can sometimes stimulate breast cancer cells and cause them to\u00a0grow. The ovaries, where your eggs are stored, begin to produce oestrogen when you start\u00a0puberty, to regulate your periods.Your risk of developing breast cancer may rise slightly with the amount of oestrogen\u00a0your body is exposed to. For example, if you started your\u00a0periods at a young age and experienced the\u00a0menopause at a late age, you'll have been exposed to oestrogen over a longer period of time. In the same way, not having children, or having children later in life, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer because your exposure to oestrogen is uninterrupted by pregnancy.Being overweight or obeseIf you've experienced the menopause and are overweight or obese, you may be more at risk of developing breast cancer. This is thought to be linked to the amount of oestrogen in your body, because being overweight or obese after the menopause causes more oestrogen to be produced.Being tallIf you're taller than average, you're more likely to develop breast cancer than someone who's shorter than average.\u00a0The reason for this isn't fully understood, but it may be due to interactions between genes, nutrition and hormones.AlcoholYour risk of developing breast cancer can increase with the amount of alcohol you drink.\u00a0RadiationCertain medical procedures that use radiation, like X-rays\u00a0and computerised tomography (CT) scans, may slightly increase your risk of developing breast cancer.If you had\u00a0radiotherapy to your chest area for Hodgkin lymphoma\u00a0when you were a child, you should have already received a written invitation from the Department of Health for a consultation with a specialist to discuss your increased risk of developing breast cancer. Speak to your GP if you weren't contacted, or if you didn't attend a consultation.If you currently need radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphoma, your specialist should discuss the risk of breast cancer before your treatment begins.Hormone replacement therapy (HRT)Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is associated with a slightly increased risk of developing breast cancer. Both combined HRT and oestrogen-only HRT can increase your risk of developing breast cancer, although the risk is slightly higher if you take combined HRT.Read further information:\nBreast Cancer Now: Breast cancer causes\nMacmillan: Breast cancer causes and risk factors\n", "Diagnosing breast cancer": "If you have suspected breast cancer, either\u00a0because of\u00a0your symptoms or because your mammogram has shown an abnormality, you'll be referred to a specialist breast clinic for further tests.What to expect at the breast clinicThe tests you'll receive at the breast clinic depend on your current symptoms, your age, and the results of the initial examination you'll have when you arrive. Many people don't need any further tests after the initial examination.Most of the time you can expect to spend up to 2 hours at the breast clinic.If you have symptoms and have been referred by your GP, you'll meet a specialist who'll examine you to determine if you need further tests.\u00a0If you're under\u00a040 years of age, the specialist\u00a0may suggest you only have a breast ultrasound scan. This is because younger women have denser breasts, which means a mammogram isn't as effective as an ultrasound\u00a0for diagnosing breast disease.If you have a mammogram, it will produce an\u00a0X-ray of your breasts. You may also need an ultrasound scan.Ultrasound uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of the inside of your breasts, showing any lumps or abnormalities. Your doctor may also suggest a breast ultrasound if they need to know whether a lump in your breast is solid or contains liquid.Read more about breast screeningA\u00a0biopsy is where a sample of tissue cells is taken from your breast and tested to see if it's cancerous. You may also need a scan and a needle test on lymph nodes in your armpit (axilla) to see whether these are also affected.Biopsies can be taken in different ways, and the type you have will depend on what your doctor knows about your condition.\u00a0Different methods of\u00a0carrying out\u00a0a biopsy are discussed below.Needle aspiration may be used to test a sample of your breast cells for cancer or to drain a benign cyst (a small fluid-filled lump). Your doctor will use a small needle to extract a sample of cells, without removing any tissue.Needle biopsy is the most common type of biopsy. A sample of tissue is taken from a lump in your breast using a large needle. You'll have a local anaesthetic, which means you'll be awake during the procedure, but your breast will be numb.Your doctor may suggest that you have a guided needle biopsy (usually guided by ultrasound or X-ray, but sometimes MRI is used) to obtain a more precise and reliable diagnosis of cancer and to distinguish it from any non-invasive change, particularly ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS).Vacuum-assisted biopsy, also known as a mammotome biopsy, is another type of biopsy. During the procedure, a needle\u00a0is attached to a gentle suction tube, which helps to\u00a0obtain the sample and clear any bleeding from the area.Read further information:\nBreast Cancer Now:\u00a0Referral to a breast clinic\nBreast Cancer Now: Your pathology report\nMacmillan: How breast cancer is diagnosed\nFurther tests for breast cancerIf a diagnosis of breast cancer is confirmed, more tests will be needed to determine the stage and grade of the cancer, and to work out the best method of treatment.\u00a0If\u00a0your\u00a0cancer was detected through the NHS Breast Screening Programme, you'll have further tests in the screening centre before being referred for treatment.\u00a0Computerised tomography (CT) scans, or chest X-ray and liver ultrasound scans, may be needed to check whether the cancer has spread to your lungs or liver. An MRI scan of the breast may be needed to clarify or to assess the extent of the condition within the breast.If your doctor thinks that the cancer could have spread to your bones, you may need a bone scan. Before having a bone scan, a substance containing a small amount of radiation, known as an isotope, will be injected into a vein in your arm. This will be absorbed into your bone if it's been affected by cancer. The affected areas of bone will show up as highlighted areas on the bone scan, which is carried out using a special camera.You'll also need tests that show whether the cancer will respond to specific types of treatment. The results of these tests can give your doctors a more complete picture of the type of cancer you have and how best to treat it. The types of test you could be offered are discussed below.In some cases, breast cancer cells can be stimulated to grow by hormones that occur naturally in your body, such as oestrogen and progesterone.If this is the case, the cancer may be treated by stopping the effects of the hormones, or by lowering the level of these hormones in your body. This is known as 'hormone therapy'.During\u00a0a hormone receptor test, a sample of cancer cells will be taken from your breast and tested to see if they respond to either oestrogen or progesterone. If the hormone is able to attach to the cancer cells (using a hormone receptor), they're known as 'hormone receptor positive'.While hormones can encourage the growth of some types of breast cancer, other types are stimulated by a protein called\u00a0human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).These types of cancer can be diagnosed using a HER2 test, and treated with medication to block the effects of HER2. This is known as 'biological' or 'targeted' therapy.Stage and grade of breast cancerWhen your breast cancer is diagnosed, the doctors will give it a stage. The stage describes the size of the cancer and how far it has spread.Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is sometimes described as stage 0. Other stages of breast cancer describe invasive breast cancer:\nstage 1 \u2013 the tumour measures less than 2cm, the lymph nodes in the armpit aren't affected, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\nstage 2 \u2013 the tumour measures 2 to 5cm or the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected, or both, and there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\nstage 3 \u2013 the tumour measures\u00a02 to 5cm and may be attached to structures in the breast, such as skin or surrounding tissues, the lymph nodes in the armpit are affected but\u00a0there are no signs that the cancer has spread elsewhere in the body\nstage 4 \u2013 the tumour is of any size and the cancer has spread to other parts of the body (metastasis)\nThis is a simplified guide. Each stage is divided into further categories: A, B and C. If you're not sure what stage you have, ask your doctor.The TNM staging system may also be used to describe breast cancer, as it can provide accurate information about the diagnosis. T describes the size of the tumour, N describes whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes, and M gives an indication of whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.The grade describes the appearance of the cancer cells.\nlow grade (G1) \u2013 the cells, although abnormal, appear to be growing slowly\nmedium grade (G2) \u2013 the cells look more abnormal than low-grade cells\nhigh grade (G3) \u2013 the cells look even more abnormal and are more likely to grow quickly\nRead further information:\nCancer Research UK: TNM breast cancer staging\nCancer Research UK: Number stages of breast cancer\n", "Treating breast cancer": "Surgery is usually the first type of treatment for breast cancer. The type of surgery you undergo will depend on the type of breast cancer you have.Surgery is usually followed by chemotherapy or radiotherapy or, in some cases, hormone or biological treatments. Again, the treatment you'll have will depend on\u00a0your type of breast cancer.Your doctor will discuss the most suitable treatment\u00a0plan with you. Chemotherapy or hormone therapy will sometimes be the first treatment.Secondary breast cancerMost breast cancers are discovered in the condition's early stages. However, a small proportion of women discover that they have breast cancer after it's spread to other parts of the body (known as metastasis).If this is the case, the type of treatment you have may be different. Secondary cancer, also called 'advanced' or 'metastatic' cancer, isn't curable and treatment aims to achieve remission (where the cancer shrinks or disappears, and you feel normal and able to enjoy life to the full).Read further information about\u00a0secondary breast cancerSurgeryThere are 2 main types of breast cancer surgery. They are:\nsurgery to remove the cancerous lump (tumour), known as breast-conserving surgery\nsurgery to remove the whole breast, which is called a mastectomy\nIn many cases, a mastectomy can be followed by reconstructive surgery to try to recreate a bulge to replace the breast that was removed.Studies have shown that breast-conserving surgery followed by radiotherapy is as successful as total mastectomy at treating early-stage breast cancer.Breast-conserving surgeryBreast-conserving surgery ranges from a lumpectomy or wide local excision, where\u00a0just the tumour and a little surrounding breast tissue is removed, to a partial mastectomy or quadrantectomy, where\u00a0up to a quarter of the breast is removed.If you have breast-conserving surgery, the amount of breast tissue you have removed will depend on the:\ntype of cancer you have\u00a0\nsize of the tumour and where it is in your breast\namount of surrounding tissue that needs to be removed\nsize of your breasts\nYour surgeon will always remove an area of healthy breast tissue around the cancer, which will be tested for traces of cancer. If there's no cancer present in the healthy tissue, there's less chance that the cancer will reoccur. If cancer cells are found in the surrounding tissue, more tissue may need to be removed from your breast.After having breast-conserving surgery, you will usually be offered radiotherapy to destroy any remaining cancer cells.MastectomyA mastectomy is the removal of all the breast tissue, including the nipple. If there are no obvious signs that the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you may have a mastectomy, where your breast is removed, along with a sentinel lymph node biopsy.If the cancer has spread to your lymph nodes, you will probably need more extensive removal (clearance) of lymph nodes from the axilla (under your arm).ReconstructionBreast reconstruction is surgery to make a new breast shape that looks as much as possible like your other breast. Reconstruction can be carried out at the same time as a mastectomy (immediate reconstruction), or it can be carried out later (delayed reconstruction). It can be done either by inserting a breast implant or by using tissue from another part of your body to create a new breast.Read further information about\u00a0breast reconstructionLymph node surgeryTo find out if the cancer has spread, a procedure called a sentinel lymph node biopsy\u00a0may be carried out.The sentinel lymph nodes are the first lymph nodes that the cancer cells reach if they spread. They're part of the lymph nodes under the arm (axillary lymph nodes). The position of the sentinel lymph nodes varies, so they're identified using a combination of a radioisotope and a blue dye.The sentinel lymph nodes are examined in the laboratory to see if there are any cancer cells present. This provides a good indicator of whether the cancer has spread.If there are cancer cells in the sentinel nodes, you may need further surgery to remove more lymph nodes from under the arm.Read further information:\nPredict: Decide on the ideal course of treatment following breast cancer surgery\nCancer Research UK: Types of breast cancer surgery\nRadiotherapyRadiotherapy uses controlled doses of radiation to kill cancer cells. It's usually given after surgery and chemotherapy to kill any remaining cancer cells.If you need radiotherapy, your treatment will begin about a month after your surgery or chemotherapy, to give your body a chance to recover. You'll probably have radiotherapy sessions 3 to 5 days a week, for 3 to 6 weeks. Each session will only last a few minutes.The type of radiotherapy you have will depend on your cancer and surgery type. Some women may not need to have radiotherapy at all. The types available are:\u00a0\nbreast radiotherapy \u2013 after breast-conserving surgery, radiation is applied to the whole of the remaining breast tissue\nchest wall radiotherapy \u2013 after a mastectomy, radiotherapy is applied to the chest wall\nbreast boost \u2013 some women may be offered a boost of high-dose radiotherapy in the area where the cancer was removed; however, the boost may affect the appearance of the breast, particularly if you have large breasts, and can sometimes have other side effects, including hardening of the breast tissue (fibrosis)\nradiotherapy to the lymph nodes \u2013 where radiotherapy is aimed at the armpit (axilla) and the surrounding area to kill any cancer that may be present in the lymph nodes\nThe side effects of radiotherapy include:\nirritation and darkening of the skin on your breast, which may lead to sore, red, weepy skin\nfatigue (extreme tiredness)\nlymphoedema\u00a0(excess fluid build-up in your arm caused by blockage of the lymph nodes under your arm)\nRead further information about\u00a0radiotherapy for breast cancerChemotherapyChemotherapy involves using anti-cancer (cytotoxic) medication to kill the cancer cells. It's usually used after surgery to destroy any cancer cells that haven't been removed. This is called adjuvant chemotherapy.In some cases, you may have chemotherapy before surgery, which is often used to shrink a large tumour. This is called neo-adjuvant chemotherapy.Several different medications are used for chemotherapy and three are often given at once. The choice of medication and the combination will depend on the type of breast cancer you have and how much it's spread.Chemotherapy is usually given as an outpatient treatment, which means\u00a0you won't have to stay in hospital overnight. The medications are usually given through a drip straight into the blood through a vein.In some cases, you may be given tablets that you can take at home. You may have chemotherapy sessions once every 2 to 3 weeks, over a period of 4 to 8 months, to give your body a rest in between treatments.The main side effects of chemotherapy are caused by their influence on normal, healthy cells, such as immune cells. Side effects include:\ninfections\nloss of appetite\nnausea and vomiting\ntiredness\nhair loss\nsore mouth\nMany side effects can be prevented or controlled with medicines that your doctor can prescribe.Chemotherapy medication can also stop the production of oestrogen in your body, which is known to encourage the growth of some breast cancers.If you haven't experienced the menopause, your periods may\u00a0stop while you're undergoing chemotherapy treatment. After you've finished the course of chemotherapy, your ovaries should start producing oestrogen again.However, this doesn't always happen and you may enter an early menopause. This is more likely in women over 40 years old, because\u00a0they're closer to menopausal age. Your doctor will discuss with you the impact that any treatment will have on your fertility.Chemotherapy for secondary breast cancerIf your breast cancer has spread beyond the breast and lymph nodes to other parts of your body, chemotherapy won't cure the cancer, but it may shrink the tumour, relieve your symptoms and help lengthen your life.Read further information about\u00a0chemotherapy for breast cancerHormone treatmentSome breast cancers are stimulated to grow by the hormones oestrogen or progesterone, which are found naturally in your body.These types of cancer are known as hormone-receptor-positive cancers. Hormone therapy works by lowering the levels of hormones in your body or by stopping their effects.The type of hormone therapy you'll have will depend on the stage and grade of your cancer, which hormone it's sensitive to, your age, whether you've experienced\u00a0the menopause and what other type of treatment you're having.You'll probably have hormone therapy after surgery and chemotherapy, but it's sometimes given before surgery to shrink a tumour, making it easier to remove.Hormone therapy may be used as the only treatment for breast cancer if your general health prevents you from having surgery, chemotherapy or radiotherapy.In most cases, you'll need to take hormone therapy for up to five years after\u00a0having surgery. If your breast cancer isn't sensitive to hormones, hormone therapy will have no effect.Tamoxifen stops oestrogen from binding to oestrogen-receptor-positive cancer cells. It's taken every day as a tablet or liquid. It can cause several side effects, including:\ntiredness\nchanges to your periods\nnausea and vomiting\nhot flushes\naching joints\nheadaches\u00a0\nweight gain\nIf you've\u00a0experienced the menopause, you may be offered an aromatase inhibitor. This type of medication works by blocking aromatase, a substance that helps produce oestrogen in the body after the menopause. Before the menopause, oestrogen is made by the ovaries.Three aromatase inhibitors may be offered. These are\u00a0anastrozole, exemestane and letrozole. These are taken as a tablet once a day. Side effects include:\nhot flushes and sweats\nlack of interest in sex (loss of libido)\nnausea and vomiting\ntiredness\naching joints and bone pain\nheadaches\nskin rashes\nIn women who haven't\u00a0experienced the menopause, oestrogen is produced by the ovaries. Ovarian ablation or suppression stops the ovaries working and producing oestrogen.Ablation can be carried out using surgery or radiotherapy. It\u00a0stops the ovaries working permanently and means you'll experience the menopause early.Ovarian suppression involves using a medication called goserelin, which is a luteinising hormone-releasing hormone agonist (LHRHa). Your periods will stop while you're taking it, although they should start again once your treatment is complete.If you're\u00a0approaching the menopause (around the age of 50), your periods may not start again after you stop taking goserelin.Goserelin is taken as an injection once a month and can cause menopausal side effects, including:\nhot flushes and sweats\nmood swings\ntrouble sleeping\nRead further information about\u00a0hormone therapyBiological therapy (targeted therapy)Some breast cancers are stimulated to grow by a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2). These cancers are called HER2-positive. Biological therapy works by stopping the effects of HER2 and by helping your immune system to fight off cancer cells.If you have high levels of the HER2 protein and are able to have biological therapy, you'll probably be prescribed a medicine called trastuzumab. Trastuzumab, also known by the brand name Herceptin,\u00a0is usually used after chemotherapy.Trastuzumab is a type of biological therapy known as a monoclonal antibody. Antibodies occur naturally in your body and are made by your immune system to destroy harmful cells, such as viruses and bacteria. The trastuzumab antibody targets and destroys cancer cells that are HER2-positive.Trastuzumab is usually given intravenously, through a drip. It's also sometimes available as an injection under the skin (a subcutaneous injection).You will have the treatment in hospital. Each treatment session takes up to one hour and the number of sessions you need will depend on whether you have early or more advanced breast cancer. On average, you'll need a session once every three weeks for early breast cancer, and weekly sessions if your cancer is more advanced.Trastuzumab can cause side effects, including heart problems. This means that it's not suitable if you have a heart problem, such as angina, uncontrolled\u00a0high blood pressure (hypertension) or heart valve disease. If you need to take trastuzumab, you'll have\u00a0regular tests on your heart to make sure it's not causing any problems.Other side effects of trastuzumab may include:\nan initial allergic reaction to the medication, which\u00a0can cause nausea, wheezing, chills and fever\ndiarrhoea\ntiredness\naches and pains\nClinical trialsA great deal of progress has been made in breast cancer treatment, and more women now live longer and have fewer side effects from treatment.These advances were discovered in clinical trials, where new treatments and treatment combinations are compared with standard ones.All cancer trials in the UK are carefully overseen to ensure they're worthwhile and safely conducted. In fact, participants in clinical trials can do better overall than those\u00a0in routine care.If you're asked to take part in a trial, you'll be given an information sheet and, if you want to take part, you'll be asked to sign a\u00a0consent form. You can refuse or withdraw from a clinical trial without it affecting your care.Read further information:\nBreast Cancer Now: Clinical trials\nAgainst Breast Cancer:\u00a0Our research\nPsychological helpDealing with cancer can be a huge challenge, for both patients and their families. It can cause emotional and practical difficulties. Many women have to cope with the removal of part or all of a breast, which can be very upsetting.It often helps to talk about your feelings or other difficulties with a trained counsellor or therapist. You can ask for this kind of help at any stage of your illness.There are various ways to find help and support. Your hospital doctor, specialist nurse or GP can refer you to a counsellor. If you're feeling depressed, talk to your GP.

If you have been through the menopause, it's particularly important that you're not overweight or obese. This is because these conditions cause more oestrogen to be produced, which can increase the risk of breast cancer.BreastfeedingStudies have shown that women who breastfeed are statistically less likely to develop breast cancer than those who don't. The reasons aren't fully understood, but it could be because women don't ovulate as regularly while they're\u00a0breastfeeding and oestrogen levels remain stable.Treatments to reduce your riskIf you have an increased risk of developing breast cancer, treatment is available to reduce your risk.Your level of risk\u00a0is determined by factors such as your age, your family's medical history and the results of genetic tests.You will usually be referred to a specialist genetics service if it's thought you have an increased risk of breast cancer.\u00a0Healthcare professionals working at these services\u00a0should discuss treatment options with you.The 2 main treatments are surgery to remove the breasts (mastectomy) or medication.A\u00a0mastectomy is surgery to remove the breasts. It can be used\u00a0to treat breast cancer and reduce the chances of developing the condition in the small number of women from high-risk families.By removing as much breast tissue as possible, a mastectomy can\u00a0reduce\u00a0your risk of breast cancer by up to 90%.However, like all operations, there's a risk of complications, and having your breasts removed can have a significant effect on your body image and sexual relationships.If you want to, you can usually choose\u00a0to have breast reconstruction either during the mastectomy operation, or at a later date. During breast reconstruction surgery, your original breast shape is recreated using either\u00a0breast implants or tissue from elsewhere in your body.An alternative is to use\u00a0breast prostheses. These are\u00a0artificial breasts\u00a0that can be worn inside your bra.Read more about your body and your breasts after treatmentIn 2013, the\u00a0National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) announced that 2 medications, called tamoxifen and raloxifene, would be available on the NHS\u00a0for women who have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.Either\u00a0tamoxifen or raloxifene can be used in women who've been through the menopause, but only tamoxifen should be used in women who haven't.These\u00a0medications may not be suitable if in the past you've had blood clots or\u00a0womb cancer, or if you have an increased risk of developing these problems in the future.Women who've already had a mastectomy to remove both breasts\u00a0won't be offered these medications, because their risk of developing breast cancer is very small.A\u00a0course of treatment with tamoxifen or raloxifene will usually involve taking a tablet every day for 5 years.Raloxifene can cause side effects including\u00a0flu-like symptoms, hot flushes and leg cramps. Side effects of tamoxifen can include hot flushes and sweats, changes to your\u00a0periods, and nausea and vomiting.Your chances of giving birth to a child with birth defects increase while you're taking tamoxifen, so\u00a0you'll be advised to stop taking it at least 2 months before trying for a baby. The medication can also increase your risk of blood clots, so you should stop taking it 6 weeks before having any planned surgery.Tamoxifen and raloxifene aren't currently licensed for the purpose of reducing the risk of breast cancer in women with an increased\u00a0risk of developing the condition. However, they can still be used if you understand the benefits and risks, and your doctor believes the treatment will be helpful.For more information, read about preventive drugs for women at high risk of breast cancerRead further information:\nBreast Cancer Now: What can cause breast cancer\nCancer Research UK: Diet and preventing breast cancer\n"}
