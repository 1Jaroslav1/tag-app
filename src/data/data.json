However, it can swell to over 5.5cm \u2013 what doctors class as a large AAA.Large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.The bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.AAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group.", "Symptoms of an abdominal aortic aneurysm": "In most cases, an unruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) will cause no symptoms, unless it becomes particularly large.Symptoms of an unruptured AAA may include:a pulsating feeling in your stomach (abdomen), usually near your belly button, that's usually only noticeable when you touch it,persistent back pain,persistent abdominal pain,If you have any of the symptoms above, you should see your GP as soon as possible.", "Causes of an abdominal aortic aneurysm": "The aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body. It transports oxygen-rich blood away from the heart to the rest of the body.An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) occurs when part of the aorta wall becomes weakened and the large amount of blood that passes through it puts pressure on the weak spot, causing it to bulge outwards to form an aneurysm.The abdominal aorta is usually around 2cm wide \u2013 about the width of a garden hosepipe \u00a0\u2013 but can swell to over 5.5cm, which is what doctors classify as a large aneurysm.", "Diagnosing an abdominal aortic aneurysm": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) usually causes no symptoms. Therefore, they tend to be diagnosed as a result of screening, or during a routine physical examination when a GP notices a distinctive pulsating sensation in your abdomen.A diagnosis can be confirmed using an ultrasound scan. Ultrasound can also determine the size of the aneurysm, which is an important factor in deciding on a course of treatment.", "Treating an abdominal aortic aneurysm": "Treatment for an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) depends on several factors, including the aneurysm's size, your age and general health.In general, if you have a large aneurysm (5.5cm or larger) you will be advised to have surgery, either to strengthen the swollen section of the aorta or to replace it with a piece of synthetic tubing.This is because the risk of the aneurysm rupturing is usually greater than the risk of having it repaired.\u00a0If you have a small (3.0-4.4cm) or medium (4.5-5.4cm) aneurysm, you will be offered regular scans to check its size.You will also be given advice on how to slow its growth and reduce the risk of it rupturing\u00a0\u2013\u00a0for example, stopping smoking \u2013 and perhaps medications to reduce your blood pressure and cholesterol level.", "Preventing an abdominal aortic aneurysm": "The best way to prevent getting an aneurysm, or reduce the risk of an aneurysm growing bigger and possibly rupturing, is to avoid anything that could damage your blood vessels.This includes:smoking,eating a high-fat diet,not exercising regularly,being overweight or obese,If your GP finds out you have high blood pressure or a high cholesterol level, you may be prescribed medication for both.

The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts.", "Diagnosing acne": "Your pharmacist can diagnose acne by looking at your skin. This involves examining your face and possibly your chest and back for different types of spot, such as blackheads or sore, red nodules.How many spots you have and how painful and inflamed they are will help determine how severe your acne is. This is\u00a0important in planning your treatment.4\u00a0grades can be used to measure the severity of acne:grade 1 (mild) \u2013 acne is mostly confined to whiteheads and blackheads, with just a few papules and pustules,grade 2 (moderate) \u2013 there are multiple papules and pustules, which are mostly confined to the face,grade 3 (moderately severe) \u2013 there's a large number of papules and pustules, as well as the occasional inflamed nodule, and the back and chest are also affected by acne,grade 4 (severe) \u2013 there's a large number of large, painful pustules and nodules,", "Treating acne": "Treatment for acne depends on how severe it is.

This fear is what causes the other symptoms, leading to weight loss and potential health risks.Even when a person with anorexia becomes extremely underweight, they can still feel compelled to lose more weight, and see themselves as being \u2018fat\u2019.Anorexia causes people who have it to focus heavily on food, even when they won\u2019t eat it. For example, they might enjoy cooking for others, but avoid eating any of the meal themselves.Some people with anorexia binge eat, meaning they eat a lot of food (or what feels to them like a lot of food) in a short space of time. They then try to avoid digesting the food and gaining weight from it by \u2018purging\u2019 \u2013 either making themselves vomit or using laxatives (medication that causes you to poo).The symptoms of anorexia usually begin gradually \u2013 someone might start a diet to help them lose a little bit of weight, but find that it spirals out of control.", "Symptoms of anorexia": "There are 3 main symptoms of anorexia:fear of \u2018being fat\u2019 or gaining weight,problems with self-esteem and body image when it comes to food and weight,restricting food intake and keeping your body weight low, to the point it\u2019s unhealthy,Restricting food intake means your body isn\u2019t getting enough energy or nutrition, which leads to other physical symptoms.Having anorexia nervosa doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t like food, or don\u2019t feel hungry \u2013 it means the mental health condition is preventing you from eating in a healthy way. People with anorexia are unable to think about food in the same way as people who don\u2019t have the condition. Instead of thinking about food as something you need to survive, someone with anorexia might be continually focused on how they can eat less, and think of different types of food as \u2018bad\u2019 or \u2018good\u2019.Anorexia can make it feel like you have to conceal your eating habits, for example by:hiding how much you\u2019ve eaten, or not eaten,avoiding eating around other people,coming up with reasons for not eating, like feeling ill, special dietary requirements, or telling people you ate before you saw them,In addition, you may find yourself thinking about food all the time.How you feel about food and your body is very personal, so symptoms and thoughts related to anorexia aren\u2019t likely to be the same for everyone. However, there are certain ways of thinking that are common in people who have anorexia.Anorexia can cause you to think, for example:that you\u2019re overweight or \u2018fat\u2019,that you\u2019re unattractive or ugly,that other people see you in a negative way \u2013 maybe that they\u2019ll find you ugly or judge you for the way you look,Also, people with anorexia often believe that they are worth more, and people will like them more, if they are thinner. They might wear baggy clothing to hide their bodies, and withdraw from social situations and hobbies.Many people will also do something called \u2018body-checking\u2019, which involves persistently and repeatedly:weighing themselves,measuring themselves, such as their waist size,checking their body in the mirror,Men with anorexia, in particular, can spend a lot of time focusing on their muscle mass, and trying to attain a specific body shape.Anorexia symptoms can make it difficult to concentrate, and cause you to have problems performing at school or work. People with anorexia often seem to lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, but they can seem very busy because of the time they spend thinking about food and weight.People with anorexia nervosa strictly control what they eat. For example, by:strict dieting,counting the calories in food,avoiding food they think is fattening,eating only low-calorie food,missing meals (fasting),hiding food instead of eating it,cutting food into tiny pieces \u2013 to make it less obvious that they\u2019ve eaten very little, and to make the food easier to swallow,taking appetite suppressants (which make you less hungry), or pills that claim to help your body digest food faster, or remove fat from food,They may also drink a lot of coffee, energy drinks, tea, and other fluids with caffeine to provide a short-term burst of energy without many calories.Some people with anorexia also use drugs known to cause weight loss, such as cocaine or amphetamines.The compulsion to burn calories often draws people with anorexia to \u2018high-impact\u2019 activities, such as running, dancing or aerobics. Some people with anorexia will use any available opportunity to burn calories, such as pacing or preferring to stand rather than sit.People with anorexia may think they can avoid absorbing calories, and try to prevent it in various ways. This can involve making themselves vomit.Signs that someone is purging by vomiting can include:leaving the room immediately after eating,dental problems, such as tooth decay or bad breath, caused by the acid in vomit damaging their teeth and mouth,hard skin on their knuckles, caused by putting their fingers down their throat,Someone with anorexia might also try to make food pass through their body as quickly as possible. For example, by either taking:laxatives (medication that helps to empty the bowels),diuretics (medication that helps remove fluid from the body),In reality, vomiting, laxatives and diuretics all have little effect on the calories absorbed from food.Eating too little for a long time can result in physical symptoms, such as:fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body,more hair on the face,pubic hair becoming sparse and thin,slow or irregular heartbeat,People with anorexia may also:have pain in their abdomen (tummy),constipated,have swelling in their feet, hands or face,feel very tired,hypotension,feel cold or have a low body temperature,feel light-headed or dizzy,In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected for someone going through puberty, and they might be shorter than other people of the same age.Women and older girls with anorexia may stop having their periods. Anorexia can also lead to infertility, for both men and women.", "Causes of anorexia": "The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors.Many people who develop anorexia share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:depression,anxiety,stress,frequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future,perfectionism \u2013 setting strict, demanding goals or standards,finding it hard to express feelings,experiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways,Environmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.Puberty can be an important factor contributing to anorexia. This is likely due to the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem during puberty.Western culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the \u2018ideal\u2019 body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that\u2019s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.The media also places significant focus on celebrities\u2019 bodies, pointing out things like cellulite or slight weight gain. This can make people feel insecure about these parts of their own bodies.Other environmental factors that can contribute towards anorexia include:pressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying \u2013 particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape,occupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics,having a family that places high value on being thin and physically active, and praises or rewards weight loss,bereavement,difficult family relationships,physical or sexual abuse,These changes may affect the part of the brain that controls appetite, or may lead to feelings of anxiety and guilt when eating. These feelings are then eased when meals are missed, or after excessive exercise.The risk of someone developing anorexia is also thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders, depression, or substance misuse, which suggests higher chances of developing these conditions could run in the family.", "Diagnosing anorexia": "When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits. For example, they could ask:if you\u2019ve lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly,how you feel about your weight, and if you\u2019re concerned about it,if you think you\u2019re overweight, even though other people think you\u2019re thin,if you make yourself vomit regularly,if you have periods, whether your periods have stopped and if so, for how long,It\u2019s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn\u2019t trying to judge you or \u2018catch you out\u2019. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.Your GP may check your weight. If someone has anorexia nervosa, their weight is generally at least 15% below average for their age, sex and height.Your GP may also calculate your body mass index (BMI). A healthy BMI for adults in Scotland is 20-25. People with anorexia generally have a BMI below 17.5.Your GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose anorexia nervosa, but they\u2019ll probably check your pulse and blood pressure.Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of:fluids in your body,chemicals or minerals, such as potassium in your blood,Blood tests look for the complications of anorexia, so even if they come back as \u2018normal\u2019, it\u2019s still likely you\u2019ll benefit from a referral to a specialist if you\u2019re experiencing anorexia symptoms.If your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they\u2019ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment. Your GP sometimes carries out this assessment.", "Treating anorexia": "Before your treatment begins, you will probably have an overall assessment of your health. This may be done by your GP or another healthcare professional, such as one that specialises in eating disorders.The assessment will help your healthcare professional draw up a plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:your overall health and any medical needs,your social situation, such as how much support you have from family and friends,your mood and any risks that affect you, such as whether you're at risk of harming yourself,whether there are any physical risks as a result of anorexia that mean urgent treatment is needed,If you are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, your GP will probably be involved in your ongoing treatment and care. Other healthcare professionals may also be involved in your treatment, such as:a specialist counsellor,a psychiatrist (doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions),psychologist,a nurse,a dietician (specialist in nutrition),If a child or teenager has anorexia, a paediatrician (doctor who specialises in children) may also be involved in their treatment.Where you are treated may depend on how mild or severe your condition is. For example, you may be treated:as an outpatient (this is most common),as a day patient or in a day unit,as in inpatient in hospital, if your weight loss or symptoms are severe,In some areas, eating disorders such as anorexia are treated by community mental health teams, which are made up of different health and social care professionals.In other areas, there are units that specialise in treating eating disorders. Some services that treat eating disorders also specialise in treating young people.It\u2019s important to start treatment as early as possible, especially if someone has already lost a lot of weight.Treatment for anorexia usually includes:psychological treatment \u2013 talking to a therapist or counsellor,advice on eating and nutrition to help you gain weight safely,These treatments work better when combined, rather than on their own.Your physical health will be monitored closely during your treatment. For example:your weight will be checked regularly,you may have regular health checks with your GP or another healthcare professional,In children and young people with anorexia, their growth, development and weight will be monitored closely. Their height will also be checked regularly against the average for their age and sex.Other health problems caused by anorexia will also be treated. For example, if you vomit regularly, you\u2019ll be encouraged to stop. You\u2019ll be given advice on dental hygiene to help prevent stomach acid damaging the enamel on your teeth. You\u2019ll also be advised to visit a dentist regularly. If you take laxatives or diuretics, you\u2019ll be advised to reduce them gradually so your body can adjust. Stopping them suddenly can cause side effects like nausea and constipation.Your care team will give you advice on how to increase the amount you eat so you can gain weight safely.They\u2019ll ask about your current eating habits and how much fluid you drink, as well as habits like smoking and drinking alcohol. This will determine what advice they give you, and help them identify any deficiencies in your diet, such as a lack of vitamins.Your care team will help you to develop healthy eating habits, such as eating more, eating more healthily, and increasing the nutritional benefits you get from food.Your body will likely need time to adjust to eating more. You may need to start by eating small amounts of food, and then gradually increasing what you eat.You may need to take supplements, such as multivitamins or multiminerals, to adjust the chemical balance in your body. Some experts think this should be done before you start gaining weight.You and your care team will work towards establishing a regular pattern of eating, with three meals a day and regular snacks. Your care team might agree a target weight with you, so you have a minimum healthy weight to aim for.If your weight loss is severe, treatment in hospital may be needed to help you start to gain weight. Your health will be closely monitored to avoid any side effects, particularly in the first few days.Various types of psychological treatment can be used to treat anorexia, such as:cognitive analytic therapy (CAT),cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),interpersonal therapy (IPT),focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT),family therapy,These different types of psychological treatments are discussed below.CAT is based on the theory that mental health conditions like anorexia are caused by unhealthy patterns of behaviour and thinking, which a person has developed in their past, usually in their childhood.CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If anorexia is causing someone to behave in an unhealthy way, CBT helps them to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how they think about food, eating, and weight.IPT is based on the idea that relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a range of effects on your mental health, both positive and negative. IPT explores the way you interact with other people and the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.Previous experiences, particularly from childhood, can influence the way you think and feel now in ways you\u2019re not aware of. The aim of FPT is to help you become aware of those effects, so you can understand why you think and feel the way you do about food, eating, and weight.Anorexia doesn\u2019t just affect one person \u2013 it can also have a big impact on their family.Family therapy involves the person with anorexia and close members of their family discussing how anorexia has affected them, and the positive changes the person and their family can make.The types of therapy available can vary depending on where you live. Although different types of therapy take different approaches, the most important part of any talking therapy is the relationship you build with your therapist.Medication alone isn\u2019t usually effective in reducing anorexia symptoms. For some people it can be helpful to prescribe medication in combination with psychological treatment.Your treatment team might prescribe nutritional or vitamin supplements for you to help your overall health.If treatment isn\u2019t improving your symptoms, or you start to get worse, your healthcare professional may consider changing your treatment. This may include treatment in hospital if your health is seriously at risk.Someone can only receive compulsory treatment if their condition is preventing them from making informed decisions about their care.It\u2019s quite common for anorexia to return after treatment \u2013 this is often referred to as relapse. It can happen, for example:if someone\u2019s weight starts to fall again,after having a baby, when a woman tries to lose the weight she gained during pregnancy,during stressful times in a person\u2019s life,", "Complications of anorexia": "If someone has anorexia for a long time, it can lead to severe complications and health problems that can sometimes be permanent.People with anorexia have an increased risk of:poor circulation and cardiovascular problems,heart conditions, such as coronary heart disease and irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia),malnutrition,Anorexia can cause an imbalance of minerals in the blood, such as potassium, calcium and sodium. These minerals play an important part in keeping you healthy. When there\u2019s an imbalance, it can cause symptoms like:tiredness,weakness,dehydration,fits,irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia),muscle spasms,confusion,Other conditions that can be caused by anorexia and malnutrition can include:hypotension,anaemia,tooth decay,hypoglycaemia,acute kidney (renal) failure,liver damage,heart failure,osteoporosis (fragile bones) and loss of muscle strength, particularly in women and girls,loss of sex drive,impotency,Misuse of laxatives can damage the bowels and cause permanent constipation.If you have anorexia and another health condition, you\u2019ll need to take extra care of your health.Anorexia can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, or cause your periods to stop altogether. This doesn\u2019t mean anorexia makes you infertile \u2013 if you have anorexia, even if your periods are irregular or have stopped, you should continue to use birth control if you aren\u2019t planning a pregnancy.If you have anorexia and are trying to become pregnant, you should discuss your plans with your GP and care team.If you are pregnant, your midwife will monitor your health closely during your pregnancy and after your baby is born. You may need extra health checks as part of your antenatal and postnatal care.Anorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, such as:miscarriage,giving birth early (premature birth),having a baby with a low birth weight,You\u2019re also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you have previously had anorexia and recovered from it.", "Getting help for anorexia": "If someone has anorexia, the most important step towards diagnosis and treatment is for them to:recognise they need help,want to get better,However, to take this first step they may need lots of support and encouragement. Because one of the main symptoms of anorexia is a fear of gaining weight, it\u2019s understandable that people who have the condition can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean eating more.If you have eating problems or think you may have anorexia, it\u2019s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:talking to someone you trust, such as a friend or member of your family,going to see your GP \u2013 you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support,If someone close to you is showing signs of anorexia, you can offer help and support.You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.If you\u2019d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:how to help the person recognise that they have a problem,the treatments available,how you can support them during their treatment,You could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders.

The face is more commonly involved in adults.The severity of atopic eczema can vary a lot from person to person. People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved.

Autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. This means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. For example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you.Autism is highly variable \u2013 the word \u2018spectrum\u2019 refers to how autism is experienced differently by different people. Autism is considered a spectrum because it\u2019s different for every autistic person \u2013 some autistic people might need more support than others to live the lives they want to lead. The way autism affects you can change as you grow and develop, and experience different environments.Many people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term \u2018autistic\u2019 to describe themselves \u2013 this is known as identity-first language (for example, \u201cI\u2019m autistic\u201d). They consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated.For a long time people used the term \u2018person on the autism spectrum\u2019, known as person-first language (for example, \u201cI\u2019m on the autism spectrum\u201d), and some people still prefer this.In this guide, we\u2019ll mostly use the term \u2018autistic\u2019.If in doubt, you can always ask an autistic person what term they\u2019d prefer.In the past, autism was broken down into several different diagnoses, including:Asperger\u2019s Syndrome,autistic disorder,Kanner\u2019s Syndrome,childhood autism,atypical autism,Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS),Because these diagnoses all had the characteristics of autism, they were removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism for short. People also use the term \u2018autism spectrum condition\u2019 (ASC).Autism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. Early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children.Even if you aren\u2019t diagnosed until adulthood, getting a diagnosis can be very helpful for identifying your strengths and the things you struggle with, and finding support.", "Characteristics of autism": "Every autistic person is different and has different experiences. However, there are some characteristics that are common in autistic people.The way these characteristics show themselves can change with age, and also with the situation you\u2019re in.For example:the way you use language and talk might be different to most people,you may use facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures (hand and body movements) differently to most people,making and maintaining friendships might be difficult for you,you may be good at seeing patterns or solutions, and be good at seeing solutions to problems that other people might not,you might have set ways of doing things, and find it difficult to do them differently,autistic people are often very good at understanding and working with structured systems, for example languages, music, and computers,you may have good attention to detail, and be good at spotting mistakes,you might be passionately interested in certain things, and as a result learn a large amount about them in a short time \u2013 these interests can change throughout your life,you might avoid or seek out certain sensations, like loud noises or specific textures, more than most people, and experience them more strongly,there might be some foods you particularly enjoy and eat a lot of, and others that you can\u2019t be around due to their texture or smell,when working on projects, you might find it difficult to think about the project as a whole \u2013 you may do a great job on your part of a group project, but struggle to imagine how it fits in with everyone else\u2019s part,while autistic people can be good at paying attention to detail, you might find it difficult to leave out details that are accurate but not needed when talking to people or working on projects,autistic people can be very determined and driven, and keep going with tasks or problems when other people may give up,you might find you\u2019re always determined to make sure things are \u2018perfect\u2019, and sometimes forget to eat or sleep if you\u2019re working on something,it can be difficult for autistic people to work in groups where there isn\u2019t clear communication about what they\u2019re expected to do,There are a number of other possible signs that a healthcare professional will look for when assessing if someone is autistic.At the moment, men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) are diagnosed with autism more often than women and those assigned female at birth (AFAB). As more healthcare professionals now know what characteristics to look for, it\u2019s becoming more common for women and AFAB people to receive an autism diagnosis. However, recognising autism can take longer for women and AFAB people. This is because the signs healthcare professionals look for are the same for everyone, but women and AFAB people can often show different characteristics.Women and AFAB people can be more likely to \u2018mask\u2019 autism \u2013 hiding\u00a0autism characteristics and copying what other people without autism do - in order to fit into groups. This can make it harder to recognise that they might be autistic, and to receive a diagnosis.Some environments can be very difficult for autistic people, due to the way they experience and interact with the world. Every autistic person finds different things difficult, but common examples are:social situations with no timetable or clear \u2018rules\u2019 on things like who speaks when \u2013 for example, parties and nights out,busy environments like concerts, supermarkets, and school playgrounds, where there might be a lot of different loud noises at once,Many environments allow autistic people to feel more comfortable and be themselves. When autistic people are in an environment with people who understand their individual needs and characteristics, they\u2019re likely to:feel more relaxed,perform better at tasks,find it easier to learn,use less time and energy trying to fit in with their environment,Because every autistic person is different, it can take time to understand how you experience different environments. It may also take time to find the environments that suit your needs, and to learn which ones to avoid.If there\u2019s an autistic person in your life, it\u2019s important to ask them what they\u2019d prefer and if there\u2019s anything you can do to make a new environment more comfortable for them.If you\u2019re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, you can ask how they felt in situations, or look for signs that they\u2019re uncomfortable during or after being in different environments. Autistic children are often able to communicate best with those closest to them about what they enjoy and don\u2019t enjoy.", "Diagnosing autism": "The signs of autism can be different depending on the person and how old they are.Because autism is present from birth, it can usually be diagnosed in childhood. However, it may only be recognised later in life. Understanding of autism has grown over time, so more people are now being diagnosed when they\u2019re older if the signs weren\u2019t recognised when they were children.These are signs of autism that health professionals look for when making a diagnosis, but an autistic person may not have all of these signs. For example, delayed speech (learning to speak later than most children), or a child not speaking at all, can be a sign of autism. However, many autistic children talk at the same age a child without autism would.It\u2019s also possible that these signs are there, but they aren\u2019t caused by autism.If you think you or your child might be autistic, talk to your GP or health visitor.The signs of autism can change as children grow \u2013 babies and toddlers show different signs of autism than children aged 4 and older.\u00a0Signs of autism in babies and toddlers can include a number of things that affect different parts of their life and behaviour.", "Living with autism": "Like everyone else, autistic people can be happy and healthy in the right environment \u2013 however, the right environment for an autistic person can be different to the right environment for a non-autistic person.Autism doesn\u2019t mean that a person will need additional support to work, have relationships, or enjoy hobbies. However, many autistic people do need additional understanding or support to overcome the challenges caused by having autistic characteristics in a society where most people don\u2019t have them.There\u2019s no cure for autism, and most autistic people wouldn\u2019t want to be \u2018cured\u2019 even if it was possible. Many autistic people feel autism is part of their identity, and not something to be cured or treated.Because of the difficulties they can experience, autistic people may need treatment or support for other conditions, including:low mood,anxiety,sleep problems,Psychological therapies can help to manage conditions linked with autism, like anxiety, but psychological therapies aren\u2019t a treatment for autism itself. Therapy techniques might need to be adapted to work for an autistic person.Depending on what\u2019s offered by your NHS board and local organisations, there are therapies to help overcome the challenges that autistic people can experience.Possible therapies include:help with communicating, both for autistic people and the people in their lives,groups for autistic people to share experiences and advice,sensory assessments and support with an occupational therapist to help find ways of managing and improving your environment and how you experience the world,training courses for loved ones, to help them understand autism and offer the best possible support,Interventions that aim to \u2018train out\u2019 behaviours (like repetitive movements, for example) or force autistic people to behave like non-autistic people are unethical and often harmful. However, many autistic people can benefit from support in learning skills to overcome some of the difficulties they experience \u2013 this is different to forcing someone to change their behaviour.For example, an autistic adult might want to learn extra social skills to improve their relationships at work, or a therapist may work with a child and parent to help them to develop their communication skills.These therapies don\u2019t aim to change a person\u2019s autism, but to give them skills they can use. If you\u2019re an autistic adult, the decision to have therapies for things like social skills should be yours. If you have an autistic child, any therapy they have should be with the aim of meeting their needs.Sometimes, when a situation is too much to cope with due to sensory input (things you see, hear, feel, smell or taste), or being asked to do things that cause stress or distress, an autistic person can become overwhelmed.When an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and isn\u2019t able to use or benefit from their coping strategies, they might have \u2018meltdowns\u2019 or \u2018shutdowns\u2019.It\u2019s important, for parents of autistic children in particular, to be aware that a meltdown isn\u2019t a tantrum. A tantrum is something that a child can control, and tantrums often happen because a child wants something. A meltdown or shutdown isn\u2019t something an autistic person can control, and it\u2019s caused by being overwhelmed.During a meltdown, an autistic person might try to make themselves feel less overwhelmed. This can include doing things like:trying to get away from people \u2013 for example by running away or hiding,trying to get people away from them \u2013 for example by shouting, screaming, hitting, or acting aggressively\u00a0,During a shutdown, an autistic person might try to block everything out \u2013 for example by not responding to anything or anyone around them.Like everyone else, autistic people can display challenging behaviour if they\u2019re in the wrong environment. While it can be challenging for the people around them, this behaviour is often a result of distress or frustration, particularly if an autistic person has difficulty with communicating.Behaviour that challenges others is usually a way for someone to get their needs met when they don\u2019t have any other way to do so. It\u2019s not \u2018bad\u2019 behaviour, or intended to cause harm. This kind of behaviour is most common in children, or people who find it hard to communicate their needs \u2013 for example, people with a learning disability.If you\u2019re autistic, effective communication about your needs, and finding ways to have those needs met, can be helpful in reducing the distress that can lead to behaviour that challenges.If someone in your life is autistic, or you\u2019re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, finding the right strategies for supporting their needs is important and helpful, and can be done if there\u2019s effective support for everyone involved.Behaviour that challenges can also be caused by:trying to meet sensory needs \u2013 for example, wanting to do something because it feels nice, like rubbing soaps and creams all over themselves and the walls,wanting something \u2013 for example, being hungry or wanting to play with a toy,needing assistance or attention \u2013 for example, because they're bored or want help with a project at school,trying to escape an environment or the people around them, but doing so in a way that can be dangerous or harmful, such as running into the road,Behaviour that people can find challenging includes:being destructive \u2013 breaking things, for example,being disruptive \u2013 making noise in class or throwing things, for example,self-harm,aggression,Help is available for anyone experiencing distress that might result in behaviour that challenges. Finding support can help you identify the reasons behind this behaviour and find other ways of communicating and meeting needs. Contact Environment is important to quality of life for autistic people. There are ways you can adapt (change) and improve your environment to make it as comfortable and supportive as possible for you or your child.The social model of disability is a way of looking at the world that treats the difficulties people with disabilities have as being caused by barriers in society, rather than just the disabilities themselves. These barriers can be physical \u2013 for example, buildings not having accessible toilets. Barriers can also be caused by people\u2019s attitudes \u2013 for example, many people will assume someone is lying because they don\u2019t make eye contact while talking.The social model of disability can be a helpful way of considering the difficulties someone faces, and how to adapt their environment so it works for them.Autism is covered by the Equality Act (2010), which means that schools and employers are required to make \u201creasonable adjustments\u201d to ensure autistic people are comfortable in their environment and able to learn or work.Common changes to an environment that can help autistic people include:sensory changes \u2013 for example, being given a quiet space to work, being able to use sensory toys like fidget spinners, or being allowed to make noises while working,communication changes \u2013 for example, using email or apps to communicate, using very clear language, allowing additional time to ask questions, or using visual communication such as photos or pictures as well as written words,routine \u2013 keeping to a regular routine and giving warning of any changes as far in advance as possible,Every autistic person is likely to benefit from different changes \u2013 the best way to find the right ones is to ask an autistic person, or in the case of a child, their parents or caregivers.", "Facts and myths about autism": "There are many incorrect beliefs about autism, particularly the causes of autism or the best ways to overcome the challenges often faced by autistic people.These things do not cause autism:bad parenting,vaccines, or any ingredients in vaccines,trauma or distress at a young age,diet,infections,There\u2019s no cure for autism, but many people incorrectly believe there are ways to cure it, or to change the way autistic people experience and interact with the world.Some fake treatments are dangerous \u2013 even the ones that aren\u2019t dangerous are unethical, and none of them are helpful.Harmful and dangerous fake treatments include:any treatment that aims to \u2018train out\u2019 autistic behaviours, like forcing someone to stop making repetitive movements,any treatment that aims to train autistic people to do things that cause them distress, in an attempt to change their behaviour and remove autistic characteristics,hyperbaric oxygen therapy \u2013 treatment with oxygen in a pressurised chamber,chelation therapy, which uses medication or other methods to remove metal from the body,chlorine dioxide (CD), also called Mineral Miracle Solution (MMS) \u2013 this is a bleach solution given via enema which can cause severe distress and physical harm,neurofeedback \u2013 where an autistic person\u2019s brain activity is monitored, usually by placing electrodes on their head, so they can see their brain activity on a screen and be told how to change it,facilitated communication \u2013 where a therapist or another person supports and guides an autistic person's hand or arm while using a device such as a computer keyboard or mouse,auditory integration training \u2013 this involves an autistic person listening to music that has changes in tone, pitch, and volume,There are some treatments that don\u2019t have any evidence to suggest they\u2019re helpful, but also don\u2019t have evidence to suggest they\u2019re harmful as long as they\u2019re done safely. These include special diets, such as gluten-free or casein-free diets. Any special diet should only be done under the supervision of a dietician or nutritionist.If you hear about a treatment that you want to try, always talk to your GP or the healthcare professional who usually supports you or your child first.There are a number of ways to identify a fake treatment. People, organisations, or websites that promote fake treatments usually:claim to \u2018cure\u2019 autism or help people \u2018recover\u2019 from autism,claim the treatment works quickly or instantly,claim the treatment can be done at home by anyone, and you don\u2019t need training or qualifications,claim you can\u2019t trust doctors to be honest with you, or say \u201cdoctors don\u2019t want you to know about this\u201d,ask autistic people, or parents of children with autism, to rely on their knowledge of their body or their child\u2019s body instead of considering scientific evidence that can tell you whether a treatment is harmful or helpful,have no scientific evidence to prove they work, such as peer-reviewed studies or information from the NHS,mainly use personal stories as evidence that they work, which makes it hard to tell if the stories are true,advertise themselves with words like \u2018miracle\u2019, \u2018faith\u2019, and \u2018trust\u2019, or use religious phrases,charge a lot of money, and often require money to be paid on a regular basis,promote treatments for autism that aren\u2019t available on the NHS, or claim to be \u2018experimental\u2019,Healthcare professionals have put together information on what treatments are safe and unsafe, and on ways to support autistic people effectively.

Younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It's been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth.", "Diagnosing benign prostate enlargement": "To find out whether your prostate gland is enlarged, you'll need to have a few tests.Some tests will be carried out by your GP and others will be carried out by a urologist (a doctor who specialises in urinary problems).", "Treating benign prostate enlargement": "The treatment for an enlarged prostate gland will depend on how severe your symptoms are.The three main treatments are:lifestyle changes,medication,surgery,If your symptoms are mild to moderate, you may not receive any immediate medical treatment, but you'll have regular check-ups to carefully monitor your prostate gland.

They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they\u2019ve finished eating.Episodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. This can lead to a vicious cycle that\u2019s difficult to break, where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly. Your blood sugar level affects how hungry you feel and how much energy your body has. When the levels go up and down quickly, this sends false messages to the brain and causes cravings for food when your body doesn't need it.", "Symptoms and treatment of binge eating disorder": "The main sign of binge eating disorder is if someone is bingeing on a regular basis. There are a number of signs that an episode of overeating is actually a binge, including:you eat much faster than normal,you eat until you feel uncomfortably full,you eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry,you eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming,you have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust afterwards,The main type of psychological treatment for binge eating disorder is guided self-help. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own, and have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist). These activities can include filling out worksheets, keeping a food diary and meal plan, and writing about difficult thoughts and feelings.Another treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either individually or as part of a group. CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If problems in your life are causing you to binge eat, CBT helps you to reduce bingeing and identify the underlying issues so you\u2019re less likely to binge in the future.As with any antidepressant, an SSRI will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You\u2019ll usually be started on a low dose, which is then gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.When you start taking an SSRI, see your GP after 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks to check your progress and to see if you\u2019re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important your progress is carefully monitored.Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It\u2019s also best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.", "Causes of binge eating disorder": "It's not clear what causes binge eating, but, like many eating disorders, it's seen as a way of coping with feelings of unhappiness and low self-esteem.Many people who develop binge eating disorder share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:depression,anxiety,stress,anger,low self-esteem,feeling dissatisfied with your body and under pressure to be thin,frequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future,finding it hard to express feelings,experiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways,Binge eating is often a way of coping with distress, and the above factors can make it harder for someone to cope with distress in a healthy way.Environmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.Stressful life changes \u2013 for example, moving house, the breakdown of a relationship, going to college or university, or a bereavement \u2013 can make a person more likely to start binge eating as a way of coping.Culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the \u2018ideal\u2019 body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that\u2019s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.Other environmental factors that can contribute towards binge eating disorder include:pressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying \u2013 particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape,having a family that places high value on body shape, and praises or rewards weight loss,difficult family relationships,stressful or traumatic events in your past,The risk of developing binge eating disorder is thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders. This suggests that genetics could contribute to developing binge eating disorder.As with other mental health conditions, like depression, people with binge eating disorder might have some differences in the way their brains work compared to people who don\u2019t have the condition. These differences may affect the part of the brain that\u2019s linked to appetite and body image.", "Getting help for binge eating disorder": "If you have eating problems or think you may have binge eating disorder, it\u2019s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:talking to someone you trust, such as a friend or member of your family,going to see your GP \u2013 you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support,If someone close to you is showing signs of binge eating disorder, you can offer help and support.You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.If you\u2019d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:the treatments available,how you can support them during their treatment,There are a number of self-help books that you may find useful, for example Overcoming Binge Eating by Christopher Fairburn.

This can be due to an infection or another condition. Sometimes, the cause is not known.Your lungs are continually exposed to germs, so\u00a0your body has sophisticated defence mechanisms designed to keep the lungs free of infection.If\u00a0a foreign substance (such as bacteria or a virus) gets past these defences, your immune system will attempt to stop the spread of any infection by sending white blood cells to the location of the infection. These cells release chemicals to fight the infection, which can cause the\u00a0surrounding tissue to become inflamed.For most people, this inflammation will pass without causing any further problems. However, bronchiectasis can occur if the inflammation permanently destroys the elastic-like tissue and muscles surrounding the bronchi (airways), causing them to widen.The abnormal bronchi then become filled with excess mucus, which can trigger persistent coughing and make the lungs more vulnerable to infection. If the lungs do become infected again, this\u00a0can result in further inflammation and further widening of the bronchi.As this cycle is repeated, the damage to the lungs gets progressively worse.

They hang suspended in the air for a while, then land on surfaces where the virus can survive for up to\u00a024 hours. Anyone who touches these surfaces can spread the virus further by touching something else.Everyday items at home and in public places, such as door handles and keyboards,\u00a0may have traces of the virus on them. People usually become infected by picking up the virus on their hands from contaminated objects, and then placing their hands near their nose or mouth. It is also possible to breathe in the virus if it is suspended in airborne droplets.", "Treating bronchitis": "Most cases of bronchitis do not require treatment from a GP, and the symptoms can be easily managed at home."}, "Bulimia": {"Introduction": "Bulimia nervosa is an eating disorder and mental health condition. People with bulimia are very anxious about their weight and focused on having the \u2018right\u2019 body shape. They also spend a lot of time thinking about food.People with bulimia overeat in a pattern known as \u2018binge eating\u2019, meaning they eat a lot of food (or what feels to them like a lot of food) in a short space of time. They then try to avoid digesting the food and gaining weight from it by \u2018purging\u2019. There are a number of ways people purge, including making themselves vomit or using laxatives (medication that causes you to poo).", "Symptoms of bulimia": "The main symptoms of bulimia are:bingeing \u2013 overeating in a particular pattern,purging \u2013 trying to reduce the effect of binging by attempting to get calories out of your body,focus on food \u2013 thinking about food all the time, even when you don\u2019t want to,problems with self-esteem and focus on body image when it comes to food and weight,In order for an episode of binge eating to be considered a binge, it should have 2 key features. The first is that the amount of food eaten is far more than normal for the situation \u2013 for example, many people eat a lot more on Christmas Day than they would on any other day, but this is normal for the situation, so it wouldn\u2019t qualify as a binge.The second feature is a feeling that the eating is out of control \u2013 feeling as if you can\u2019t stop eating. You might feel disconnected \u2013 as if you\u2019re watching the binge happen from outside your body.There may be times when a person eats a relatively small amount of food, but it still feels like a binge because they feel a loss of control.Binge eating is usually a very quick process and you may feel physically uncomfortable afterwards. When binge eating is a symptom of bulimia, it happens regularly, not just once or twice.Binge eating episodes are sometimes spontaneous, where you eat anything you can find. They can also be planned, where you make a shopping trip to buy foods specifically to binge on.People often find eating comforting. Binges can start as a way to cope with difficult emotions, but become increasingly frequent and out of control.After bingeing, you might feel guilty, anxious, and angry with yourself. You may also feel uncomfortable physically, for example you might feel sick or bloated from the amount you\u2019ve eaten. Purging is a response to these feelings, as well as an attempt to \u2018undo\u2019 any weight gain that could be caused by the binge.There are a number of ways that people try to purge:making yourself vomit,laxatives,amphetamines,In reality, purging has little effect on the calories absorbed from food.People with bulimia experience \u2018intrusive thoughts\u2019 about food. Intrusive thoughts are unwanted thoughts that come into your mind without you wanting to think about them. Because people with bulimia are concerned about gaining weight and body image, but they also consider food something comforting, these thoughts cause distress.Part of the problem for many people with bulimia is that they\u2019ve learned that eating is comforting. When they feel distress, they want to eat in order to feel better.People with bulimia also often restrict what they eat, which means that they are feeling hungry often, so they think more about food. When someone is very hungry, intrusive thoughts about food are likely.After a certain period of time where people with bulimia try to avoid eating, in order to avoid gaining weight, they are likely to lose control and binge.People with bulimia often have problems with their self-esteem in general, and as a result can spend a lot of time thinking about their body shape and eating habits. This can lead to setting strict rules about dieting, eating or exercising, which are very hard to maintain.When people with bulimia are unable to keep to these strict rules, they tend to binge eat. After feeling guilty about binging, they purge to get rid of the calories.These feelings of guilt then further affect self-esteem, causing what\u2019s often called a \u2018cycle of guilt\u2019.", "Causes of bulimia": "The exact causes of bulimia are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors.Many people who develop bulimia share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:depression,anxiety,stress,frequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future,perfectionism \u2013 setting strict, demanding goals or standards that are unrealistic for them to maintain,finding it hard to express feelings,experiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways,Environmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.Puberty can be an important factor contributing to bulimia. This is likely due to the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem during puberty.Stressful life changes \u2013 for example, moving house, the breakdown of a relationship, going to college or university, or a bereavement \u2013 can also have an impact. When these changes happen during puberty, the effect can be even greater.Western culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the \u2018ideal\u2019 body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that\u2019s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.The media also places significant focus on celebrities\u2019 bodies, pointing out things like cellulite or slight weight gain. This can make people feel insecure about these parts of their own bodies.Other environmental factors that can contribute towards bulimia include:pressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying \u2013 particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape,occupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics,having a family that places high value on being thin and physically active, and praises or rewards weight loss,difficult family relationships,physical or sexual abuse,The risk of developing bulimia is thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders. This suggests that genetics could contribute to developing bulimia.As with other mental health conditions, like depression, people with bulimia might have some differences in the way their brains work compared to people who don\u2019t have the condition. These differences may affect the part of the brain that\u2019s linked to appetite and body image.", "Diagnosing bulimia": "When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your eating habits. For example, they could ask:how you feel about your weight, and if you\u2019re concerned about it,if you make yourself vomit regularly,if you binge-eat,It\u2019s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn\u2019t trying to judge you or \u2018catch you out\u2019. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.Your GP may check your weight and calculate your body mass index (BMI). A healthy BMI for adults in Scotland is 20-25.Your GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose bulimia, but they\u2019ll probably check your pulse and blood pressure.Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of:fluids in your body,chemicals or minerals, such as potassium in your blood,Blood tests look for the complications of bulimia, so even if they come back as \u2018normal\u2019, you may still benefit from a referral to a specialist if you\u2019re experiencing bulimia symptoms.", "Treating bulimia": "Before your treatment begins, you will probably have an overall assessment of your health. This may be done by your GP or another healthcare professional, such as one that specialises in eating disorders.The assessment will help your healthcare professional draw up a plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:your overall health and any medical needs,your social situation, such as how much support you have from family and friends,your mood and any risks that affect you, such as whether you are at risk of harming yourself,whether there are any physical risks as a result of bulimia that mean urgent treatment is needed,For many people, guided self-help can be an effective treatment for bulimia. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own, and have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist). These activities can include filling out worksheets, keeping a food diary and meal plan, and writing about difficult thoughts and feelings.If this is unsuccessful, your GP can refer you for treatment to an eating disorder service, where you may be offered a structured programme of psychological treatment.Some people may also benefit from antidepressant medication (fluoxetine), as this can reduce the urges to binge and vomit.The main type of psychological treatment for bulimia is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If bulimia is causing someone to behave in an unhealthy way, CBT helps them to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how they think about food, eating, and weight.One alternative to CBT is interpersonal therapy (IPT). IPT is based on the idea that relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a range of effects on your mental health, both positive and negative. IPT explores the way you interact with other people and the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.The types of therapy available can vary depending on where you live. Although different types of therapy take different approaches, the most important part of any talking therapy is the relationship you build with your therapist.As with any antidepressant, an SSRI will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You\u2019ll usually be started on a low dose, which is then gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.When you start taking an SSRI, see your GP after 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks to check your progress and to see if you\u2019re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important your progress is carefully monitored.Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It\u2019s also best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease.Recovery from bulimia can take a long time, and it\u2019s quite common for bulimia symptoms to return after treatment \u2013 this is often referred to as relapse, and is more likely during times of stress. If relapse happens, the approach to getting treatment is the same \u2013 the first step is going to your GP.", "Complications of bulimia": "There are a number of physical complications associated with bulimia.These can include:dental problems \u2013 regular vomiting can cause your stomach acid to damage the enamel on your teeth, which can lead to tooth decay,sore throat,due to a lack of nutrients, your skin and hair can become dry and your fingernails can become brittle,your saliva glands can become swollen from frequent vomiting, which makes your face appear rounder,frequent vomiting or laxative use can cause chemical imbalances in your body \u2013 this can cause tiredness, weakness, abnormal heart rhythms, kidney damage, convulsions (fits), and muscle spasms,laxatives,long-term complications of bulimia can include an increased risk of heart problems,If you have periods, bulimia can cause them to become unpredictable, or even stop altogether. This does not mean bulimia makes you infertile \u2013 while it may be harder to get pregnant, you should continue to use birth control if you aren\u2019t planning a pregnancy.Bulimia isn\u2019t usually treated in hospital. However, if you have serious health complications and your life is at risk, you may be admitted to hospital.", "Getting help for bulimia": "If someone has bulimia, the most important steps towards diagnosis and treatment\u00a0are for them to:recognise they need help,want to get better,However, to take this first step they may need lots of support and encouragement. It\u2019s understandable that people who have bulimia can be anxious about seeking treatment that might mean making changes to their eating habits.If you have eating problems or think you may have bulimia, it\u2019s important to seek help as soon as possible. You could start by:talking to someone you trust, such as a friend or member of your family,going to see your GP \u2013 you may find it helpful to bring someone with you for support,If someone close to you is showing signs of bulimia, you can offer help and support.You could try talking to them about how they feel, and encourage them to think about getting help. Try not to put pressure on them or be critical of them, as this could make things worse. You could also offer to help by going with the person to see their GP.If you\u2019d like to get some advice on how to help, a healthcare professional, such as your own GP, can provide information on:how to help the person recognise that they have a problem,the treatments available,how you can support them during their treatment,You could also get help from a support group for people who have loved ones with eating disorders.

Lubricant for vaginal sex is only recommended for women that have low vaginal moisture.Only water-based lubricant (such as K-Y Jelly) rather than an oil-based lubricant (such as Vaseline or massage and baby oil) should be used with condoms.Oil-based lubricants weaken the latex in condoms and can cause them to break or tear.Many local authorities and pharmacies offer needle exchange programmes, where used needles can be exchanged for clean ones.A GP or drug counsellor should be able to advise you about free injecting equipment provision including needles.If you are having a tattoo or piercing, it's important that a clean, sterilised needle is always used.", "Living with HIV": "HIV is a long term condition which is easy to manage and treat.

Blood contains oxygen and other nutrients that are needed to help keep tissue healthy. Without a constant blood supply, tissue is\u00a0damaged\u00a0and will eventually die.The lack of blood supply also means that the skin no longer receives infection-fighting white blood cells. Once an ulcer has developed, it can become infected by bacteria.People with normal mobility do not develop pressure ulcers, as their body automatically makes hundreds of regular movements that prevent pressure building up on any part of their body.For example, you may think that you are lying still when asleep, but you may shift position up to 20 times a night.Pressure ulcers can be caused by:pressure from a hard surface \u2013 such as a bed or wheelchair,pressure that is placed on the skin through involuntary muscle movements \u2013 such as muscle spasms,moisture \u2013 which can break down the outer layer of the skin (epidermis),The time it takes for a pressure ulcer to form will depend on:the amount of pressure,how vulnerable a person's skin is to damage,Grade 3\u00a0or 4\u00a0pressure ulcers can develop quickly. For example, in susceptible people, a full-thickness pressure ulcer can sometimes develop in just 1\u00a0or 2\u00a0hours.

Normal red blood cells are round \u2013 red blood cells affected by sickle cell disease harden and become sickle-shaped, like a crescent moon. This causes them to die too quickly and block blood vessels, leading to symptoms that are often painful.People from particular ethnic backgrounds are more likely to have sickle cell disease or carry the gene. You are more likely to have sickle cell disease if you are from one of these ethnic backgrounds:African,Asian,Caribbean,Eastern Mediterranean,Middle Eastern,There are treatments to manage sickle cell disease, but no cure yet \u2013 it's a lifelong condition.", "\u200bSymptoms and diagnosis": "The main symptoms of sickle cell disease are sickle cell crises (very painful episodes affecting different parts of the body), infections, and anaemia.There are a number of serious problems that can appear suddenly as a result of sickle cell disease. If you experience any of the following symptoms, you should get medical advice immediately:high temperature (a fever) going to 38C (100.4F) or higher,difficulty breathing,drowsiness, confusion, or slurred speech,a severe headache, stiff neck, or dizziness,skin or lips that are very pale,fits (seizures),serious pain that isn't responding to treatments at home,sudden swelling in the tummy,priapism \u2013 a painful erection lasting two hours or more,weakness on one or both sides of your body,sudden vision loss, or changes in your vision,If you develop any of the symptoms listed above, phone your GP or care team immediately. If you can't contact your GP or care team, go to your closest Accident and Emergency (A&E) department. Dial 999 for an ambulance if you aren't able to travel yourself.It's important to make sure that the medical team looking after you know that you have sickle cell disease.Episodes of pain known as sickle cell crises happen when the blood vessels that go to one part of your body become blocked. The pain can be severe.Sickle cell crises are one of the most common symptoms of sickle cell disease and, on average, occur once a year and last up to seven days. Some people have sickle cell crises every few weeks \u2013 others experience them less than once a year.A sickle cell crisis typically affects one part of the body at a time. The most common parts affected are:hands or feet (this is especially common in young children),ribs and breastbone,spine,pelvis,tummy,legs and arms,Sickle cell crises have different causes. They can be triggered by cold, rainy or windy weather, stress, dehydration, or exercise that leaves you severely out of breath.Sickle cell disease leaves people \u2013 especially children \u2013 extra vulnerable to infection because their bodies aren't as effective at dealing with bacteria and viruses. This leaves them more vulnerable to viruses like the common cold, as well as severe and potentially life-threatening conditions like meningitis.As well as keeping up to date with their vaccinations, many people with sickle cell disease take daily doses of antibiotics in order to prevent infections.Almost everyone with sickle cell disease has anaemia. Haemoglobin is found in red blood cells \u2013 it's the substance that transports oxygen around the body. People with anaemia have low levels of haemoglobin in their blood.Most of the time anaemia doesn't cause symptoms, but if you're infected with parvovirus, the virus that causes slapped cheek syndrome, the anaemia can get worse. When that happens, it causes:headaches,a fast heartbeat,fainting,dizziness,If these symptoms occur, the anaemia is usually treated with a blood transfusion.Sudden anaemia can happen in young children if they experience swelling of the spleen. This is also treated with a blood transfusion.There's a wide range of other issues that can be caused by sickle cell disease. These include:a serious lung condition called acute chest syndrome that can cause chest pain, a cough, breathing difficulties and fever,pain in bones and joints,delayed puberty,delayed growth in childhood,kidney or urinary problems, including bedwetting and blood in the urine,gallstones \u2013 these are stones in the gallbladder that can cause jaundice (yellow eyes and skin) and abdominal (tummy) pain,ulcers on the lower legs (open sores that can be very painful),priapism \u2013 a painful, persistent erection that can last for several hours,high blood pressure (pulmonary hypertension),transient ischaemic attacks (TIAs) or strokes \u2013 these happen when blood flow to the brain is interrupted or blocked,enlarged spleen \u2013 this can cause a fast heartbeat, worsening of anaemia, a swollen tummy, shortness of breath and abdominal pain,vision problems like floaters, worsened night vision, blurred vision, patchy vision and, occasionally, sudden vision loss,You can have a blood test any time to find out if you have sickle cell disease, or find out if you're a carrier who could have a child with the condition.Sickle cell disease is usually diagnosed during pregnancy \u2013 free screening to find out if a baby is at risk of having the condition is offered to every pregnant woman in Scotland.Even if your family background doesn't make it likely your child will have sickle cell disease, you can still request a test.If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there's time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease.Newborn babies are screened for sickle cell disease as part of the newborn blood spot test \u2013 the heel prick test. There are a few reasons for this:if a baby's parents weren't screened during pregnancy, this test identifies if the child has sickle cell disease,if screening during pregnancy showed that the baby had a high risk of having sickle cell disease, but no more testing was done, the heel prick test will determine if the child has the condition or not,here,the heel prick test identifies other inherited conditions, like cystic fibrosis,Another blood test will be used to confirm the diagnosis if the heel prick test suggests that the baby could have sickle cell disease.", "\u200bTreating sickle cell disease": "People of all ages with sickle cell disease are supported by a team of medical professionals in a specialist sickle cell centre. A specialised care plan will be developed with you that helps you to fully understand the condition and find the best way of managing it.Sickle cell crises can usually be managed at home. The following steps are recommended for adults or children experiencing a sickle cell crisis:over the counter painkillers like paracetamol and ibuprofen can help \u2013 although aspirin should not be given to anyone under 16 \u2013 and if needed, your GP may prescribe stronger painkillers,heating pads or warm towels can be placed on the area and massaged to ease the pain \u2013 pharmacies usually sell heating pads you can use for this,drink plenty \u2013 staying hydrated will help,relaxing distractions like reading, videos, and computer games are a good way to distract your mind, or your child's mind, from the pain,If none of the above measures help, or the pain is very severe, phone your GP. You or your child should go to the local accident and emergency (A&E) if it's not possible to contact your GP. It may be necessary for you or your child to spend a few days in hospital being treated with stronger pain relief.The best way to prevent a sickle cell crisis is by being aware of potential triggers and avoiding them.Prevent dehydration by drinking plenty of fluids \u2013especially water.,Avoid alcohol \u2013 alcohol causes dehydration.,Stay warm with enough layers of clothing to avoid getting cold, and avoid extreme temperatures.,Don't expose yourself to sudden changes in temperature \u2013 for example, avoid swimming in cold water.,The lack of oxygen at high altitudes can trigger a sickle cell crisis, so be careful if you're at high altitude for any reason. However, plane travel shouldn't be an issue because planes maintain a consistent oxygen level due to being pressurised.,Make sure to stay active, but avoid activities that leave you severely out of breath.,Don't smoke \u2013 smoking can trigger acute chest syndrome.,breathing exercises,Your care team may recommend a medication called hydroxycarbamide (hydroxyurea) if you keep experiencing sickle cell crises. This is a capsule that is taken once a day. It works by reducing how many other types of blood cell, like white blood cells and platelets (clotting cells) there are in the body.This means that you'll need regular blood tests to make sure you're healthy.Children who have sickle cell disease should be kept up to date on all of their routine vaccinations, and may also need additional vaccinations like the hepatitis B vaccine and the annual flu vaccine.If you have sickle cell disease, you'll most likely need to take a dose of antibiotics every day, usually penicillin. This will not pose serious health risks.Most of the time, anaemia doesn't have any symptoms and you won't require any treatment for it. However, children with sickle cell anaemia who are also on a restricted diet (such as a vegan or vegetarian diet) may need folic acid supplements. Folic acid helps your body to create more red blood cells, so it can help to improve anaemia.It's important to be aware that this type of anaemia isn't the same as the anaemia caused by iron deficiency, so don't take iron supplements without talking to your care team first. Taking iron supplements with the anaemia caused by sickle cell disease can be dangerous.Blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide may be necessary for serious or persistent anaemia.There are a range of treatments for other problems that can be caused by sickle cell disease, depending on the type of symptom and how severe it is:people with acute chest syndrome need emergency treatment \u2013 this involves oxygen, blood transfusions, antibiotics, and fluids given through a vein, as well as possibly hydroxycarbamide to prevent it happening again,painkillers can treat joint and bone pain,a short course of hormones can be given to children in order to trigger delayed puberty,gallbladder removal surgery is used to treat gallstones,for persistent priapism, medication can stimulate blood flow, or a needle can be used to drain blood from the penis,regular blood transfusions or hydroxycarbamide are given to people who have had a stroke or who are at greater risk of having one,In addition to the treatments above, chelation therapy involves taking medication to make the level of iron in your blood lower, bringing it to safe levels. This treatment is given to people who need a lot of blood transfusions.", "\u200bLiving with sickle cell disease": "Sickle cell disease is a lifelong illness, which can be managed well with treatment and self-help. In addition to preventing symptoms and crises as much as possible, there are a few things you can do that will make it easier to live with the condition and stay in the best possible health.If you're due to have surgery, or you're brought in for surgery in an emergency, it's very important you take some precautions.You should tell your care team about any surgeries you have planned that involve a general anaesthetic.Tell your surgeon on the day that you have sickle cell disease.General anaesthetic can cause a number of problems, including increasing the risk of a sickle cell crisis. It's important that you're monitored closely during the surgery, and are given plenty of fluids as well as being kept warm.It might be necessary to have a blood transfusion before the surgery to reduce the chances of complications.You can have a healthy pregnancy if you have sickle cell disease, but it's a good idea to talk to your care team before planning a pregnancy, for a number of reasons:there's a bigger chance of complications such as miscarriage, pre-eclampsia, anaemia and sickle cell pain while you're pregnant,you may have to stop taking some of the medications for sickle cell disease, like hydroxycarbamide, before getting pregnant, as these can harm a foetus,it may be a good idea to find out if your partner is a sickle cell carrier and talk with a counsellor about what this could mean,extra monitoring during pregnancy, as well as extra treatment, might be necessary,Most children with sickle cell disease lead normal, happy lives. However, sickle cell disease can be very different from person to person, and it's still a serious condition.Sickle cell disease can have a big impact on someone's life. It can lead to serious infections, strokes and transcient ischaemic attacks (TIAs), and lung problems, which can be fatal.The overall live expectancy for people with sickle cell disease is shorter than normal, but this changes depending on the type of sickle cell disease, what problems they experience, and how the condition is treated.Milder types of sickle cell disease may not impact life expectancy. People with sickle cell anaemia have a typical life expectancy of between 40 and 60 years of age. As newer treatments are developed, it's hoped that the outlook will get better.", "\u200bCauses of sickle cell disease": "Sickle cell disease is caused by a gene problem that is inherited from your parents. It isn't something you can catch, and it's not caused by anything the parents did during or before pregnancy.You inherit one set of genes from your mother, and one from your father. Genes always come in pairs. Children born with sickle cell disease inherit a copy of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, so each one of the pair of genes is faulty.This happens when both parents are \"carriers\" \u2013 they carry the faulty gene for sickle cell. This is also known as having the sickle cell trait.Carriers don't have sickle cell disease, but if their partner is a carrier too they may have a child with the condition.When both of a child's parents are sickle cell carriers:there's a 25% (one in four) chance that each of their children won't inherit any faulty genes \u2013 they won't have sickle cell disease, and they won't be able to pass it on to their children,there's a 50% (one in two) chance that each child will inherit a copy of the faulty gene from just one parent, and be a sickle cell carrier,there's a 25% (one in four) chance that each child will inherit copies of the sickle cell gene from both of their parents, and have sickle cell disease when they're born,", "\u200bSickle cell disease carriers and screening": "Sickle cell disease carriers are people who carry the faulty gene that causes sickle cell disease, but do not have the disease. This is also called having the sickle cell trait.If you have the sickle cell trait, you won't develop sickle cell disease. However, there's a risk that you'll have a child with the condition, or who is also a sickle cell disease carrier.The sickle cell gene can be carried by anyone, but people from certain ethnic backgrounds are much more likely to be carriers.You are more likely to be a carrier if you have family from one of these areas :Africa,Asia,The Caribbean,The Eastern Mediterranean,The Middle East,Most sickle cell carriers in the UK have an African or Caribbean family background \u2013 it's estimated around one in ten people with this background may be a sickle cell carrier.You can request a blood test from your GP at any time to find out if you're a sickle cell carrier. This is a particularly good idea if your family background makes it more likely that you have the gene.Both men and women are able to get the test.Every pregnant woman in Scotland is offered screening to check if their baby is at risk of being born with sickle cell disease. You can ask for a test even if your family background doesn't suggest your child will have sickle cell disease. It's a good idea to have your partner screened for the gene too.If possible, screening should be done before the tenth week of pregnancy, so that there's time to think about further tests that can find out if your baby will be born with sickle cell disease."}, "Sinusitis": {"About sinusitis": "Sinusitis is a common condition in which the lining of the sinuses becomes inflamed.

Further treatment is usually only needed for the small number of people who have a recurrence.For\u00a0stage 1 non-seminomas, close follow-up (called surveillance) may also be recommended, or a short course of chemotherapy using a combination of different medications.For stage 2, 3 and 4 testicular cancers, 3 to 4 cycles of chemotherapy are given using a combination of different medications. Further surgery is sometimes needed after chemotherapy to remove any affected lymph nodes or deposits in the lungs or, rarely, in the liver.Some people with stage 2 seminomas may be suitable for less intense treatment with radiotherapy, sometimes with the addition of a simpler form of\u00a0chemotherapy.In non-seminoma germ cell tumours, additional surgery may also be required after chemotherapy to remove tumours from other parts of the body, depending on the extent of the spread of the tumour.Deciding what treatment is best for you can be difficult. Your cancer team will make recommendations, but the final decision will be yours.Before discussing your treatment options with your\u00a0specialist,\u00a0you may find it useful to write a list of questions to ask them.

Surgery and chemotherapy are the 2 main types of treatment. Often people have both treatments.To make sure you have the right treatment, your specialist needs to know what stage the cancer is. The stage of a cancer describes the tumour and whether it has spread outside the testicle. You may need some more tests to confirm what stage you are at. Waiting to hear about the stage of the cancer can be worrying. But this information is important because it helps your doctors plan the right treatment.Treatment for testicular cancer can be really successful.

Some of the main causes are:varicoceles,hydroceles,epididymal cysts,epididymo-orchitis \u2013 inflammation of the epididymis and testicles,inguinal hernias \u2013\u00a0where fatty tissue or a part of your bowel pokes through into your groin, which can cause the scrotum to become enlarged,A sudden and severely painful swelling in one of your testicles can be a sign of a condition called testicular torsion, which is where the blood supply to a testicle is interrupted.You should see your GP if you notice any lumps, swellings or changes in your testicles.Your GP will ask you about your symptoms and examine your testicles to try to identify the cause of the problem.If you experience sudden or severe pain in your testicles, it's important to contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible because urgent treatment may be required.", "Causes of testicular lumps and swellings": "Most testicular lumps and swellings\u00a0are caused by benign (non-cancerous) conditions, although occasionally they can be a symptom of testicular cancer.Some of the main types of testicular lumps and swellings are outlined below.There are a number of different benign causes of testicular lumps and swellings.Most of these conditions are largely harmless and may not require treatment, although you should seek immediate medical advice if you suspect you have testicular torsion (see below) because it needs to be treated quickly.Varicoceles are soft lumps that usually develop gradually above the testicle and mostly on the left side of the scrotum (the loose sac of skin that contains the testicles). They are sometimes described as feeling like a \"bag of worms\".The exact cause of varicoceles is not clear, but it is widely thought that they occur as the result of abnormalities in the veins in the testicles leading to\u00a0a build-up of excess blood in the veins, which makes them swell.The size of varicoceles can vary. Some may only be noticeable when you touch them. Others can be larger and seen easily. The side of the scrotum that contains the varicoceles may hang slightly lower than the other side.Besides a lump, varicoceles do not usually cause any other symptoms, although some men and anyone with testicles who have them experience a heavy feeling or aching pain in their scrotum or groin.In a few cases, varicoceles have been linked to infertility. However, there is no evidence that surgically removing them improves your chances of being able to have a baby.Hydroceles are swellings in the scrotum caused by a build-up of fluid.They often affect newborn babies, usually only causing a painless swelling of one or both testicles, although they can\u00a0sometimes affect older boys, men and anyone with testicles, who may feel some discomfort in the scrotum.During pregnancy, a male baby's testicles develop inside his abdomen (tummy) and they pass down into the scrotum through a passage once they are formed. This passage usually closes before birth, but in some cases it stays open. If the passage remains open, fluid can pass from the abdomen into the scrotum, causing the swelling associated with a hydrocele.In most cases affecting babies, the fluid is absorbed into the surrounding tissue during the child's first year or two of life, and the hydrocele disappears.Hydroceles that develop in men, older boys and anyone with testicles may be caused by inflammation (swelling) of the scrotum resulting from problems such as an injury or infection.An epididymal cyst is a small, smooth fluid-filled swelling that slowly develops in the\u00a0epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm).They\u00a0are often painless, but the affected testicle may sometimes ache or feel heavy. You may also experience some pain and discomfort if the cyst puts pressure on other structures in or around your testicle.It's not clear what causes\u00a0epididymal cysts, but they tend to be more common\u00a0in middle-aged men and anyone with testicles.Epididymo-orchitis is the inflammation of the epididymis as well as the testicle, causing the affected testicle to become swollen, painful and tender over a matter of hours or days.It's not always clear what causes\u00a0epididymo-orchitis, but\u00a0the condition\u00a0is often linked to an infection, including:sexually transmitted infections (STIs),urinary tract infections (UTIs),mumps,Epididymo-orchitis can sometimes\u00a0lead to a reduced sperm count, although this is rarely significant enough to cause infertility.An\u00a0inguinal hernia occurs when fatty tissue or a part of your bowel, such as the intestine, pokes through into your groin at the top of your inner thigh.The hernia can appear as a swelling or lump in your groin, or as an enlarged scrotum.\u00a0The lump is often painless, but\u00a0it can become suddenly and severely painful if the blood supply to\u00a0the section of organ or tissue trapped in the hernia has become cut off (strangulation).If you think you have a hernia that has become strangulated, you\u00a0should visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible because urgent surgery may be required.Inguinal hernias occur when the tissue or bowel pushes through a weak spot in the surrounding muscle wall (the abdominal wall) into the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is a channel through which blood vessels to the testicles pass in men and through which the round ligament (the ligament surrounding the womb) passes in women.Testicular torsion is a benign but serious condition caused by the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies the testicles with blood) becoming severely twisted.Unlike the other types of benign testicular lumps and swellings, testicular torsion is a medical emergency. You should contact your GP immediately or visit your nearest accident and emergency (A&E) department as soon as possible if you suspect you have testicular torsion.Signs and symptoms of testicular torsion include:a sudden, severe pain in one of your testicles,swelling of the scrotum,nausea,vomiting,abdominal (tummy) pain,If\u00a0the spermatic cord becomes severely twisted, the blood supply for the affected testicle can be interrupted. If this is not treated quickly with surgery, there is a risk of losing the affected testicle.Testicular torsion can occur at any age, but is most common in\u00a0boys aged 13\u00a0to 17 and is rare in men and anyone with testicles over 30. It can also affect newborn babies and even unborn babies in the womb.Most cases\u00a0happen for no apparent reason, although the problem can occur in boys who are born with an unusually loose spermatic cord and it can develop after an injury to the testicles.You may also be at a higher risk of developing testicular torsion\u00a0if you have a history of undescended testicles (where a boy is born without both testicles in their scrotum).Lumps associated with testicular cancer tend to develop slowly on the testicle itself (as opposed to the scrotum) are usually:painless (although some people do experience pain or discomfort),solid and firm,not tender to touch,Unlike many other types of cancer, the risk of testicular cancer does not keep increasing as you get older. The condition is most often diagnosed in boys, men and anyone with testicles between the ages of 15 and 49. It's uncommon in men and anyone with testicles older than this.", "Diagnosing testicular lumps and swellings": "<strong>Visit your GP if you notice any changes in your testicles. </strong>Your GP will ask you whether you have:felt any pain,\u00a0and if so, where it was, how severe it was, how\u00a0suddenly it developed\u00a0and how long it has lasted\u00a0,any other symptoms, such as pain when you urinate or any discharge from your penis, which could be a sign of an infection,a history of trauma, such as a sports injury to your groin\u00a0,They will also want to examine your testicles to check:the size of your testicles\u00a0,the position of the lump or swelling\u00a0,whether the lump causes any pain when it is touched\u00a0,whether the lump is firm or soft,Your GP may hold a small light or torch against the lump in your testicle to see whether light passes through it. This can help differentiate between solid lumps and lumps caused by a build-up of fluid (such as hydroceles).Depending on what your GP thinks may be the cause of your symptoms, you may be referred to a specialist \u2013 such as\u00a0a urologist (a doctor specialising in conditions affecting the urinary system) \u2013 for further assessment or your GP may arrange more tests.If testicular torsion is suspected, you will usually be referred to hospital for an urgent assessment to see whether an immediate operation is necessary.Your GP may take\u00a0a urine sample if they suspect your lump or swelling may be caused by an infection. They\u00a0may also use a swab (small cotton bud) to collect a sample of cells and fluid from your urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body). This sample can also be tested to see if you have an infection.An ultrasound scan can help give a clearer indication of\u00a0whether the lump is solid or filled with fluid and can help determine the likelihood of the lump being cancerous.", "Treating testicular lumps and swellings": "Treatment for your testicular lump or swelling will depend on the underlying cause.\u00a0Some lumps may not need to be treated at all if they are not causing any problems.In most cases, varicoceles do not require treatment. They usually don't cause other symptoms or long-term problems.Your GP can refer you to a urologist (a doctor specialising in conditions affecting the urinary system) who can discuss the option of surgery with you if your varicocele is still causing your problems.In many cases, a technique called varicocele embolisation can be used to treat problematic varicoceles.Hydroceles in newborn babies usually disappear by the time the baby reaches two years of age. Treatment is usually only needed if they persist for longer than this, or cause pain or discomfort.Treatment may also be recommended in boys or adults with a hydrocele that is particularly large or is causing any other symptoms. In such cases, you can be referred to a surgeon to discuss your options.A\u00a0surgical procedure known as a hydrocelectomy\u00a0is often recommended for hydroceles. \u00a0In children, an incision is made in the groin before sealing the passage between the abdomen (tummy) and the scrotum that allows fluid to flow into the scrotum.\u00a0In adults, the incision is made in the scrotum, the fluid is drained away and the incision is closed using dissolvable stitches.Both procedures are usually carried out under general anaesthetic and most people\u00a0will be\u00a0able to return home soon after having the operation.You may experience some discomfort, swelling, and fluid seepage from the wound after the procedure, but this should only last for a few days. Taking simple painkillers and wearing supportive underwear may help reduce any discomfort in the meantime.As with a varicocele embolisation, there is a small risk of infection after a hydrocelectomy and\u00a0there is a possibility the hydrocele could recur.Epididymal cysts don't normally require treatment because they are usually harmless and don't cause other symptoms. However, if\u00a0you have a cyst that is getting bigger or is causing any pain or discomfort, you may be\u00a0referred to a urologist to discuss the possibility of surgery.A procedure to remove an epididymal cyst is carried out under general anaesthetic and involves removing the cysts through a small incision in your scrotum that is sealed with dissolvable stitches.In some cases,\u00a0it may also be necessary to remove the epididymis (a coil-like structure behind the testicles that helps to store and transport sperm) to prevent another cyst from forming.As with other procedures, you may experience some discomfort, swelling, and fluid seepage from the wound for a few days after the procedure, but this should only last for a few days.\u00a0Taking simple painkillers and wearing supportive underwear may help reduce any discomfort.There is also a small risk of the wound becoming infected\u00a0and there is a chance of cysts recurring if the epididymis is not removed.If your GP suspects\u00a0epididymo-orchitis has occurred as a complication of a\u00a0mumps infection, antibiotics are not used because mumps is caused by a virus.In these cases, the\u00a0swelling and pain in the testicles will usually resolve within a week or two. Wearing supportive underwear, applying cold or warm compresses to your testicles and taking simple painkillers may help reduce discomfort in the meantime.You may be referred to a surgeon to discuss\u00a0the option of having an operation to push the bulge back into place and strengthen the weakness in the abdominal wall.This operation\u00a0will be\u00a0carried\u00a0out urgently if there are signs that the blood supply to the tissue forming the lump has become interrupted (strangulated), because\u00a0this can cause the affected tissue\u00a0to\u00a0die.There are two ways that an inguinal hernia repair can be performed:open surgery \u2013 where one cut is made to allow the surgeon to push the lump back into the abdomen,keyhole (laparoscopic) surgery \u2013 a less invasive but more difficult technique where several smaller cuts are made, allowing the surgeon to use various special instruments to repair the hernia,There are advantages and disadvantages to both methods. The type of surgery you have will depend on which method suits you and your surgeon\u2019s experience. With both types of surgery, you should be able to go home the same day or the day after.An inguinal hernia repair is a routine operation with very few risks. Although it is not uncommon for a hernia to recur at some point after surgery.If you have testicular torsion, you will need\u00a0surgery as soon as possible to\u00a0untwist the\u00a0testicle. Permanent injury to the testicle can occur within hours of having testicular torsion, which may affect your fertility or result in the loss of your testicle.Surgery for testicular torsion is carried out under general anaesthetic. The surgeon will make an incision in your scrotum before untwisting the spermatic cord (the cord that supplies the testicles with blood). The testicle (or testicles) will then be stitched to the inside of the scrotum to prevent the spermatic cord twisting again.The longer you wait before having surgery, the higher the risk that your surgeon will not be able to save the trapped testicle. Research has found\u00a0that when\u00a0men have surgery within six hours of testicular torsion occurring,\u00a0nine out of 10 twisted testicles will be saved. However, if the surgery is delayed for 24 hours, only\u00a0one out of 10 twisted testicles will be saved.If it is not possible to save the affected testicle, the surgeon will need to remove it and seal the spermatic cord. In these cases, another operation can be carried out at a later date to fit a replacement\u00a0artificial (prosthetic) testicle.If you have been diagnosed with testicular cancer, you will be cared for by a team of clinicians, who will help decide the best treatment for you.This will depend on factors such as the specific type of testicular cancer you have and how far it had spread before it was diagnosed.If you want, you can have a prosthetic testicle inserted into your scrotum so that the appearance of your testicles is not greatly affected.In rare cases where it is necessary to remove both testicles, you will become infertile. However, you may be able to bank your sperm before the operation to allow you to father children in the future."}, "Thirst": {}, "Threadworms": {"About threadworms": "Threadworms, also known as pinworms, are tiny parasitic worms that infect the large intestine of humans.Threadworms\u00a0are a common type of\u00a0worm\u00a0infection in the UK, particularly in children under the age of\u00a010.The worms\u00a0are white and look like small pieces of thread.
