            "text": "An abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) is a swelling (aneurysm) of the aorta – the main blood vessel that leads away from the heart, down through the abdomen to the rest of the body.The abdominal aorta is the largest blood vessel in the body and is usually around 2cm wide – roughly the width of a garden hose. However, it can swell to over 5.5cm – what doctors class as a large AAA.Large aneurysms are rare, but can be very serious. If a large aneurysm bursts, it causes huge internal bleeding and is usually fatal.The bulging occurs when the wall of the aorta weakens. Although what causes this weakness is unclear, smoking and high blood pressure are thought to increase the risk of an aneurysm.AAAs are most common in men aged over 65. A rupture accounts for more than 1 in 50 of all deaths in this group."

The glands are attached to hair follicles, which are small holes in your skin that an individual hair grows out of.Sebaceous glands lubricate the hair and the skin to stop it drying out. They do this by producing an oily substance called sebum.In acne, the glands begin to produce too much sebum. The excess sebum mixes with dead skin cells and both substances form a plug in the follicle.If the plugged follicle is close to the surface of the skin, it bulges outwards, creating a whitehead. Alternatively, the plugged follicle can be open to the skin, creating a blackhead.Normally harmless bacteria that live on the skin can then contaminate and infect the plugged follicles, causing papules, pustules, nodules or cysts."

However, in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, scientists have found amyloid plaques (abnormal deposits of protein), neurofibrillary tangles (containing tau) and imbalances in a chemical called acetylcholine.It's also common to have a degree of vascular damage in the brain.These reduce the effectiveness of healthy neurons (nerve cells that carry messages to and from the brain), gradually destroying them.Over time, this damage spreads to several areas of the brain. The first areas affected are responsible for memories."

For example, they might enjoy cooking for others, but avoid eating any of the meal themselves.Some people with anorexia binge eat, meaning they eat a lot of food (or what feels to them like a lot of food) in a short space of time. They then try to avoid digesting the food and gaining weight from it by ‘purging’ – either making themselves vomit or using laxatives (medication that causes you to poo).The symptoms of anorexia usually begin gradually – someone might start a diet to help them lose a little bit of weight, but find that it spirals out of control."

        "symptoms": {
            "title": "Symptoms of anorexia",
            "text": "There are 3 main symptoms of anorexia:fear of ‘being fat’ or gaining weight,problems with self-esteem and body image when it comes to food and weight,restricting food intake and keeping your body weight low, to the point it’s unhealthy,Restricting food intake means your body isn’t getting enough energy or nutrition, which leads to other physical symptoms.Having anorexia nervosa doesn’t mean you don’t like food, or don’t feel hungry – it means the mental health condition is preventing you from eating in a healthy way. People with anorexia are unable to think about food in the same way as people who don’t have the condition. Instead of thinking about food as something you need to survive, someone with anorexia might be continually focused on how they can eat less, and think of different types of food as ‘bad’ or ‘good’.Anorexia can make it feel like you have to conceal your eating habits, for example by:hiding how much you’ve eaten, or not eaten,avoiding eating around other people,coming up with reasons for not eating, like feeling ill, special dietary requirements, or telling people you ate before you saw them,In addition, you may find yourself thinking about food all the time.How you feel about food and your body is very personal, so symptoms and thoughts related to anorexia aren’t likely to be the same for everyone. However, there are certain ways of thinking that are common in people who have anorexia.Anorexia can cause you to think, for example:that you’re overweight or ‘fat’,that you’re unattractive or ugly,that other people see you in a negative way – maybe that they’ll find you ugly or judge you for the way you look,Also, people with anorexia often believe that they are worth more, and people will like them more, if they are thinner. They might wear baggy clothing to hide their bodies, and withdraw from social situations and hobbies.Many people will also do something called ‘body-checking’, which involves persistently and repeatedly:weighing themselves,measuring themselves, such as their waist size,checking their body in the mirror,Men with anorexia, in particular, can spend a lot of time focusing on their muscle mass, and trying to attain a specific body shape.Anorexia symptoms can make it difficult to concentrate, and cause you to have problems performing at school or work. People with anorexia often seem to lose interest in activities they used to enjoy, but they can seem very busy because of the time they spend thinking about food and weight.People with anorexia nervosa strictly control what they eat. For example, by:strict dieting,counting the calories in food,avoiding food they think is fattening,eating only low-calorie food,missing meals (fasting),hiding food instead of eating it,cutting food into tiny pieces – to make it less obvious that they’ve eaten very little, and to make the food easier to swallow,taking appetite suppressants (which make you less hungry), or pills that claim to help your body digest food faster, or remove fat from food,They may also drink a lot of coffee, energy drinks, tea, and other fluids with caffeine to provide a short-term burst of energy without many calories.Some people with anorexia also use drugs known to cause weight loss, such as cocaine or amphetamines.The compulsion to burn calories often draws people with anorexia to ‘high-impact’ activities, such as running, dancing or aerobics. Some people with anorexia will use any available opportunity to burn calories, such as pacing or preferring to stand rather than sit.People with anorexia may think they can avoid absorbing calories, and try to prevent it in various ways. This can involve making themselves vomit.Signs that someone is purging by vomiting can include:leaving the room immediately after eating,dental problems, such as tooth decay or bad breath, caused by the acid in vomit damaging their teeth and mouth,hard skin on their knuckles, caused by putting their fingers down their throat,Someone with anorexia might also try to make food pass through their body as quickly as possible. For example, by either taking:laxatives (medication that helps to empty the bowels),diuretics (medication that helps remove fluid from the body),In reality, vomiting, laxatives and diuretics all have little effect on the calories absorbed from food.Eating too little for a long time can result in physical symptoms, such as:fine downy hair (lanugo) growing on the body,more hair on the face,pubic hair becoming sparse and thin,slow or irregular heartbeat,People with anorexia may also:have pain in their abdomen (tummy),constipated,have swelling in their feet, hands or face,feel very tired,hypotension,feel cold or have a low body temperature,feel light-headed or dizzy,In children with anorexia, puberty and the associated growth spurt may be delayed. They may gain less weight than expected for someone going through puberty, and they might be shorter than other people of the same age.Women and older girls with anorexia may stop having their periods. Anorexia can also lead to infertility, for both men and women."

            "title": "Causes of anorexia",
            "text": "The exact causes of anorexia nervosa are unclear, but most specialists believe it's likely to be the result of a combination of factors.Many people who develop anorexia share certain patterns of thinking and behaving that may make them more likely to develop the condition. These include:depression,anxiety,stress,frequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future,perfectionism – setting strict, demanding goals or standards,finding it hard to express feelings,experiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways,Environmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.Puberty can be an important factor contributing to anorexia. This is likely due to the combination of hormonal changes and feelings of stress, anxiety and low self-esteem during puberty.Western culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the ‘ideal’ body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that’s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.The media also places significant focus on celebrities’ bodies, pointing out things like cellulite or slight weight gain. This can make people feel insecure about these parts of their own bodies.Other environmental factors that can contribute towards anorexia include:pressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying – particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape,occupations or hobbies where being thin is seen as the ideal, such as dancing or athletics,having a family that places high value on being thin and physically active, and praises or rewards weight loss,bereavement,difficult family relationships,physical or sexual abuse,These changes may affect the part of the brain that controls appetite, or may lead to feelings of anxiety and guilt when eating. These feelings are then eased when meals are missed, or after excessive exercise.The risk of someone developing anorexia is also thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders, depression, or substance misuse, which suggests higher chances of developing these conditions could run in the family."

            "title": "Diagnosing anorexia",
            "text": "When making a diagnosis, your GP will probably ask questions about your weight and eating habits. For example, they could ask:if you’ve lost a lot of weight recently or quite quickly,how you feel about your weight, and if you’re concerned about it,if you think you’re overweight, even though other people think you’re thin,if you make yourself vomit regularly,if you have periods, whether your periods have stopped and if so, for how long,It’s important to answer these questions honestly. Your GP isn’t trying to judge you or ‘catch you out’. They just need to accurately assess how serious your symptoms are.Your GP may check your weight. If someone has anorexia nervosa, their weight is generally at least 15% below average for their age, sex and height.Your GP may also calculate your body mass index (BMI). A healthy BMI for adults in Scotland is 20-25. People with anorexia generally have a BMI below 17.5.Your GP may not need to carry out any tests to diagnose anorexia nervosa, but they’ll probably check your pulse and blood pressure.Your GP may do blood tests to check the level of:fluids in your body,chemicals or minerals, such as potassium in your blood,Blood tests look for the complications of anorexia, so even if they come back as ‘normal’, it’s still likely you’ll benefit from a referral to a specialist if you’re experiencing anorexia symptoms.If your GP thinks you may have anorexia, they’ll refer you to a specialist in eating disorders for a more detailed assessment.

This may be done by your GP or another healthcare professional, such as one that specialises in eating disorders.The assessment will help your healthcare professional draw up a plan for your treatment and care. For example, they may assess:your overall health and any medical needs,your social situation, such as how much support you have from family and friends,your mood and any risks that affect you, such as whether you're at risk of harming yourself,whether there are any physical risks as a result of anorexia that mean urgent treatment is needed,If you are diagnosed with anorexia nervosa, your GP will probably be involved in your ongoing treatment and care. Other healthcare professionals may also be involved in your treatment, such as:a specialist counsellor,a psychiatrist (doctor who specialises in treating mental health conditions),psychologist,a nurse,a dietician (specialist in nutrition),If a child or teenager has anorexia, a paediatrician (doctor who specialises in children) may also be involved in their treatment.Where you are treated may depend on how mild or severe your condition is. For example, you may be treated:as an outpatient (this is most common),as a day patient or in a day unit,as in inpatient in hospital, if your weight loss or symptoms are severe,In some areas, eating disorders such as anorexia are treated by community mental health teams, which are made up of different health and social care professionals.In other areas, there are units that specialise in treating eating disorders. Some services that treat eating disorders also specialise in treating young people.It’s important to start treatment as early as possible, especially if someone has already lost a lot of weight.Treatment for anorexia usually includes:psychological treatment – talking to a therapist or counsellor,advice on eating and nutrition to help you gain weight safely,These treatments work better when combined, rather than on their own.Your physical health will be monitored closely during your treatment. For example:your weight will be checked regularly,you may have regular health checks with your GP or another healthcare professional,In children and young people with anorexia, their growth, development and weight will be monitored closely. Their height will also be checked regularly against the average for their age and sex.Other health problems caused by anorexia will also be treated. For example, if you vomit regularly, you’ll be encouraged to stop. You’ll be given advice on dental hygiene to help prevent stomach acid damaging the enamel on your teeth. You’ll also be advised to visit a dentist regularly. If you take laxatives or diuretics, you’ll be advised to reduce them gradually so your body can adjust. Stopping them suddenly can cause side effects like nausea and constipation.Your care team will give you advice on how to increase the amount you eat so you can gain weight safely.They’ll ask about your current eating habits and how much fluid you drink, as well as habits like smoking and drinking alcohol. This will determine what advice they give you, and help them identify any deficiencies in your diet, such as a lack of vitamins.Your care team will help you to develop healthy eating habits, such as eating more, eating more healthily, and increasing the nutritional benefits you get from food.Your body will likely need time to adjust to eating more. You may need to start by eating small amounts of food, and then gradually increasing what you eat.You may need to take supplements, such as multivitamins or multiminerals, to adjust the chemical balance in your body. Some experts think this should be done before you start gaining weight.You and your care team will work towards establishing a regular pattern of eating, with three meals a day and regular snacks. Your care team might agree a target weight with you, so you have a minimum healthy weight to aim for.If your weight loss is severe, treatment in hospital may be needed to help you start to gain weight. Your health will be closely monitored to avoid any side effects, particularly in the first few days.Various types of psychological treatment can be used to treat anorexia, such as:cognitive analytic therapy (CAT),cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT),interpersonal therapy (IPT),focal psychodynamic therapy (FPT),family therapy,These different types of psychological treatments are discussed below.CAT is based on the theory that mental health conditions like anorexia are caused by unhealthy patterns of behaviour and thinking, which a person has developed in their past, usually in their childhood.CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If anorexia is causing someone to behave in an unhealthy way, CBT helps them to change the harmful behaviour while working on changing how they think about food, eating, and weight.IPT is based on the idea that relationships with other people and the outside world in general have a range of effects on your mental health, both positive and negative. IPT explores the way you interact with other people and the relationships you have, with the goal of improving them.Previous experiences, particularly from childhood, can influence the way you think and feel now in ways you’re not aware of. The aim of FPT is to help you become aware of those effects, so you can understand why you think and feel the way you do about food, eating, and weight.Anorexia doesn’t just affect one person – it can also have a big impact on their family.Family therapy involves the person with anorexia and close members of their family discussing how anorexia has affected them, and the positive changes the person and their family can make.The types of therapy available can vary depending on where you live. Although different types of therapy take different approaches, the most important part of any talking therapy is the relationship you build with your therapist.Medication alone isn’t usually effective in reducing anorexia symptoms. For some people it can be helpful to prescribe medication in combination with psychological treatment.Your treatment team might prescribe nutritional or vitamin supplements for you to help your overall health.If treatment isn’t improving your symptoms, or you start to get worse, your healthcare professional may consider changing your treatment. This may include treatment in hospital if your health is seriously at risk.Someone can only receive compulsory treatment if their condition is preventing them from making informed decisions about their care.It’s quite common for anorexia to return after treatment – this is often referred to as relapse. It can happen, for example:if someone’s weight starts to fall again,after having a baby, when a woman tries to lose the weight she gained during pregnancy,during stressful times in a person’s life,"

These minerals play an important part in keeping you healthy. When there’s an imbalance, it can cause symptoms like:tiredness,weakness,dehydration,fits,irregular heartbeat (arrhythmia),muscle spasms,confusion,Other conditions that can be caused by anorexia and malnutrition can include:hypotension,anaemia,tooth decay,hypoglycaemia,acute kidney (renal) failure,liver damage,heart failure,osteoporosis (fragile bones) and loss of muscle strength, particularly in women and girls,loss of sex drive,impotency,Misuse of laxatives can damage the bowels and cause permanent constipation.If you have anorexia and another health condition, you’ll need to take extra care of your health.Anorexia can lead to irregular menstrual cycles, or cause your periods to stop altogether. This doesn’t mean anorexia makes you infertile – if you have anorexia, even if your periods are irregular or have stopped, you should continue to use birth control if you aren’t planning a pregnancy.If you have anorexia and are trying to become pregnant, you should discuss your plans with your GP and care team.If you are pregnant, your midwife will monitor your health closely during your pregnancy and after your baby is born. You may need extra health checks as part of your antenatal and postnatal care.Anorexia during pregnancy can increase the risk of complications, such as:miscarriage,giving birth early (premature birth),having a baby with a low birth weight,You’re also likely to need extra care and support during pregnancy if you have previously had anorexia and recovered from it."

For asbestosis to develop, prolonged exposure to relatively high numbers of the fibres is necessary. However, it is not the only factor, as many people avoid getting asbestosis, despite heavy exposure."

People with mild eczema may only have small areas of dry skin that are occasionally itchy. In more severe cases, atopic eczema can cause widespread red, inflamed skin all over the body and constant itching.Scratching can disrupt your sleep, make your skin bleed, and cause secondary infections. It can also make itching worse, and a cycle of itching and regular scratching may develop. This can lead to sleepless nights and difficulty concentrating at school or work.Areas of skin affected by eczema may also turn temporarily darker or lighter after the condition has improved. This is more noticeable in people with darker skin.

            "title": "About autism",
            "text": "Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), usually called autism, is something you’re born with. Autism means that the way you think about and experience the world is different to most people. This means you can behave differently to most people, and have different strengths and difficulties. For example, some autism characteristics (things you think, feel and do) can make it hard to express yourself in social situations, but you may also be particularly knowledgeable and passionate about topics that interest you.Autism is highly variable – the word ‘spectrum’ refers to how autism is experienced differently by different people. Autism is considered a spectrum because it’s different for every autistic person – some autistic people might need more support than others to live the lives they want to lead. The way autism affects you can change as you grow and develop, and experience different environments.Many people who have been diagnosed with autism prefer using the term ‘autistic’ to describe themselves – this is known as identity-first language (for example, “I’m autistic”). They consider autism to be part of their identity, not a condition to be treated.For a long time people used the term ‘person on the autism spectrum’, known as person-first language (for example, “I’m on the autism spectrum”), and some people still prefer this.In this guide, we’ll mostly use the term ‘autistic’.If in doubt, you can always ask an autistic person what term they’d prefer.In the past, autism was broken down into several different diagnoses, including:Asperger’s Syndrome,autistic disorder,Kanner’s Syndrome,childhood autism,atypical autism,Pervasive Development Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS),Because these diagnoses all had the characteristics of autism, they were removed and replaced with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism for short. People also use the term ‘autism spectrum condition’ (ASC).Autism is always present from birth, but it might not be recognised or diagnosed until adulthood. Early intervention, in the form of support for their individual needs, can be helpful for autistic children.Even if you aren’t diagnosed until adulthood, getting a diagnosis can be very helpful for identifying your strengths and the things you struggle with, and finding support."

        "characteristics": {
            "title": "Characteristics of autism",
            "text": "Every autistic person is different and has different experiences. However, there are some characteristics that are common in autistic people.The way these characteristics show themselves can change with age, and also with the situation you’re in.For example:the way you use language and talk might be different to most people,you may use facial expressions, tone of voice, and gestures (hand and body movements) differently to most people,making and maintaining friendships might be difficult for you,you may be good at seeing patterns or solutions, and be good at seeing solutions to problems that other people might not,you might have set ways of doing things, and find it difficult to do them differently,autistic people are often very good at understanding and working with structured systems, for example languages, music, and computers,you may have good attention to detail, and be good at spotting mistakes,you might be passionately interested in certain things, and as a result learn a large amount about them in a short time – these interests can change throughout your life,you might avoid or seek out certain sensations, like loud noises or specific textures, more than most people, and experience them more strongly,there might be some foods you particularly enjoy and eat a lot of, and others that you can’t be around due to their texture or smell,when working on projects, you might find it difficult to think about the project as a whole – you may do a great job on your part of a group project, but struggle to imagine how it fits in with everyone else’s part,while autistic people can be good at paying attention to detail, you might find it difficult to leave out details that are accurate but not needed when talking to people or working on projects,autistic people can be very determined and driven, and keep going with tasks or problems when other people may give up,you might find you’re always determined to make sure things are ‘perfect’, and sometimes forget to eat or sleep if you’re working on something,it can be difficult for autistic people to work in groups where there isn’t clear communication about what they’re expected to do,There are a number of other possible signs that a healthcare professional will look for when assessing if someone is autistic.At the moment, men and those assigned male at birth (AMAB) are diagnosed with autism more often than women and those assigned female at birth (AFAB). As more healthcare professionals now know what characteristics to look for, it’s becoming more common for women and AFAB people to receive an autism diagnosis. However, recognising autism can take longer for women and AFAB people. This is because the signs healthcare professionals look for are the same for everyone, but women and AFAB people can often show different characteristics.Women and AFAB people can be more likely to ‘mask’ autism – hiding autism characteristics and copying what other people without autism do - in order to fit into groups. This can make it harder to recognise that they might be autistic, and to receive a diagnosis.Some environments can be very difficult for autistic people, due to the way they experience and interact with the world. Every autistic person finds different things difficult, but common examples are:social situations with no timetable or clear ‘rules’ on things like who speaks when – for example, parties and nights out,busy environments like concerts, supermarkets, and school playgrounds, where there might be a lot of different loud noises at once,Many environments allow autistic people to feel more comfortable and be themselves. When autistic people are in an environment with people who understand their individual needs and characteristics, they’re likely to:feel more relaxed,perform better at tasks,find it easier to learn,use less time and energy trying to fit in with their environment,Because every autistic person is different, it can take time to understand how you experience different environments. It may also take time to find the environments that suit your needs, and to learn which ones to avoid.If there’s an autistic person in your life, it’s important to ask them what they’d prefer and if there’s anything you can do to make a new environment more comfortable for them.If you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, you can ask how they felt in situations, or look for signs that they’re uncomfortable during or after being in different environments. Autistic children are often able to communicate best with those closest to them about what they enjoy and don’t enjoy."

For example, delayed speech (learning to speak later than most children), or a child not speaking at all, can be a sign of autism. However, many autistic children talk at the same age a child without autism would.It’s also possible that these signs are there, but they aren’t caused by autism.If you think you or your child might be autistic, talk to your GP or health visitor.The signs of autism can change as children grow – babies and toddlers show different signs of autism than children aged 4 and older. Signs of autism in babies and toddlers can include a number of things that affect different parts of their life and behaviour."

            "text": "Like everyone else, autistic people can be happy and healthy in the right environment – however, the right environment for an autistic person can be different to the right environment for a non-autistic person.Autism doesn’t mean that a person will need additional support to work, have relationships, or enjoy hobbies. However, many autistic people do need additional understanding or support to overcome the challenges caused by having autistic characteristics in a society where most people don’t have them.There’s no cure for autism, and most autistic people wouldn’t want to be ‘cured’ even if it was possible. Many autistic people feel autism is part of their identity, and not something to be cured or treated.Because of the difficulties they can experience, autistic people may need treatment or support for other conditions, including:low mood,anxiety,sleep problems,Psychological therapies can help to manage conditions linked with autism, like anxiety, but psychological therapies aren’t a treatment for autism itself. Therapy techniques might need to be adapted to work for an autistic person.Depending on what’s offered by your NHS board and local organisations, there are therapies to help overcome the challenges that autistic people can experience.Possible therapies include:help with communicating, both for autistic people and the people in their lives,groups for autistic people to share experiences and advice,sensory assessments and support with an occupational therapist to help find ways of managing and improving your environment and how you experience the world,training courses for loved ones, to help them understand autism and offer the best possible support,Interventions that aim to ‘train out’ behaviours (like repetitive movements, for example) or force autistic people to behave like non-autistic people are unethical and often harmful. However, many autistic people can benefit from support in learning skills to overcome some of the difficulties they experience – this is different to forcing someone to change their behaviour.For example, an autistic adult might want to learn extra social skills to improve their relationships at work, or a therapist may work with a child and parent to help them to develop their communication skills.These therapies don’t aim to change a person’s autism, but to give them skills they can use. If you’re an autistic adult, the decision to have therapies for things like social skills should be yours. If you have an autistic child, any therapy they have should be with the aim of meeting their needs.Sometimes, when a situation is too much to cope with due to sensory input (things you see, hear, feel, smell or taste), or being asked to do things that cause stress or distress, an autistic person can become overwhelmed.When an autistic person becomes overwhelmed and isn’t able to use or benefit from their coping strategies, they might have ‘meltdowns’ or ‘shutdowns’.It’s important, for parents of autistic children in particular, to be aware that a meltdown isn’t a tantrum. A tantrum is something that a child can control, and tantrums often happen because a child wants something. A meltdown or shutdown isn’t something an autistic person can control, and it’s caused by being overwhelmed.During a meltdown, an autistic person might try to make themselves feel less overwhelmed. This can include doing things like:trying to get away from people – for example by running away or hiding,trying to get people away from them – for example by shouting, screaming, hitting, or acting aggressively ,During a shutdown, an autistic person might try to block everything out – for example by not responding to anything or anyone around them.Like everyone else, autistic people can display challenging behaviour if they’re in the wrong environment. While it can be challenging for the people around them, this behaviour is often a result of distress or frustration, particularly if an autistic person has difficulty with communicating.Behaviour that challenges others is usually a way for someone to get their needs met when they don’t have any other way to do so. It’s not ‘bad’ behaviour, or intended to cause harm. This kind of behaviour is most common in children, or people who find it hard to communicate their needs – for example, people with a learning disability.If you’re autistic, effective communication about your needs, and finding ways to have those needs met, can be helpful in reducing the distress that can lead to behaviour that challenges.If someone in your life is autistic, or you’re the parent or caregiver of an autistic child, finding the right strategies for supporting their needs is important and helpful, and can be done if there’s effective support for everyone involved.Behaviour that challenges can also be caused by:trying to meet sensory needs – for example, wanting to do something because it feels nice, like rubbing soaps and creams all over themselves and the walls,wanting something – for example, being hungry or wanting to play with a toy,needing assistance or attention – for example, because they're bored or want help with a project at school,trying to escape an environment or the people around them, but doing so in a way that can be dangerous or harmful, such as running into the road,Behaviour that people can find challenging includes:being destructive – breaking things, for example,being disruptive – making noise in class or throwing things, for example,self-harm,aggression,Help is available for anyone experiencing distress that might result in behaviour that challenges. Finding support can help you identify the reasons behind this behaviour and find other ways of communicating and meeting needs. Contact Environment is important to quality of life for autistic people. There are ways you can adapt (change) and improve your environment to make it as comfortable and supportive as possible for you or your child.The social model of disability is a way of looking at the world that treats the difficulties people with disabilities have as being caused by barriers in society, rather than just the disabilities themselves. These barriers can be physical – for example, buildings not having accessible toilets. Barriers can also be caused by people’s attitudes – for example, many people will assume someone is lying because they don’t make eye contact while talking.The social model of disability can be a helpful way of considering the difficulties someone faces, and how to adapt their environment so it works for them.Autism is covered by the Equality Act (2010), which means that schools and employers are required to make “reasonable adjustments” to ensure autistic people are comfortable in their environment and able to learn or work.Common changes to an environment that can help autistic people include:sensory changes – for example, being given a quiet space to work, being able to use sensory toys like fidget spinners, or being allowed to make noises while working,communication changes – for example, using email or apps to communicate, using very clear language, allowing additional time to ask questions, or using visual communication such as photos or pictures as well as written words,routine – keeping to a regular routine and giving warning of any changes as far in advance as possible,Every autistic person is likely to benefit from different changes – the best way to find the right ones is to ask an autistic person, or in the case of a child, their parents or caregivers."

People, organisations, or websites that promote fake treatments usually:claim to ‘cure’ autism or help people ‘recover’ from autism,claim the treatment works quickly or instantly,claim the treatment can be done at home by anyone, and you don’t need training or qualifications,claim you can’t trust doctors to be honest with you, or say “doctors don’t want you to know about this”,ask autistic people, or parents of children with autism, to rely on their knowledge of their body or their child’s body instead of considering scientific evidence that can tell you whether a treatment is harmful or helpful,have no scientific evidence to prove they work, such as peer-reviewed studies or information from the NHS,mainly use personal stories as evidence that they work, which makes it hard to tell if the stories are true,advertise themselves with words like ‘miracle’, ‘faith’, and ‘trust’, or use religious phrases,charge a lot of money, and often require money to be paid on a regular basis,promote treatments for autism that aren’t available on the NHS, or claim to be ‘experimental’,Healthcare professionals have put together information on what treatments are safe and unsafe, and on ways to support autistic people effectively. If you’re unsure about any treatment, ask your GP or the healthcare professional who supports you or your child.If you see someone promoting a fake or harmful treatment on social media or a web forum, you can make a report to the administrators of that online community.There are a number of websites that can provide more information and advice for autistic people and their families:"

Younger men and anyone with a prostate produce high levels of testosterone and much smaller levels of oestrogen. But as they get older, levels of testosterone decrease, which means they then have a higher proportion of oestrogen in their body. It's been suggested that the relative increase in oestrogen may stimulate prostate growth."

            "title": "Introduction",
            "text": "Binge eating is an eating disorder where a person feels they have to overeat through regular binges.People who binge eat consume very large amounts of food over a short period of time, even when they’re not hungry.Binges are often planned in advance and can involve the person buying ‘special’ binge foods.In some cases, people describe themselves as being in a ‘dazed’ state during a binge – particularly binges during the night – and can’t remember what they ate.People who binge eat feel they have no control over their eating. They often binge in private because they feel embarrassed, guilty or disgusted with their behaviour after they’ve finished eating.Episodes of binge eating sometimes alternate with periods where the person cuts down on the amount of food they eat. This can lead to a vicious cycle that’s difficult to break, where blood sugar levels rise and fall rapidly. Your blood sugar level affects how hungry you feel and how much energy your body has. When the levels go up and down quickly, this sends false messages to the brain and causes cravings for food when your body doesn't need it."

        "symptoms": {
            "title": "Symptoms and treatment of binge eating disorder",
            "text": "The main sign of binge eating disorder is if someone is bingeing on a regular basis. There are a number of signs that an episode of overeating is actually a binge, including:you eat much faster than normal,you eat until you feel uncomfortably full,you eat a large amount of food when you are not hungry,you eat alone or secretly due to being embarrassed about the amount of food you are consuming,you have feelings of guilt, shame or disgust afterwards,The main type of psychological treatment for binge eating disorder is guided self-help. Guided self-help is where you work through information and activities on your own, and have regular support sessions with a professional (usually a psychologist). These activities can include filling out worksheets, keeping a food diary and meal plan, and writing about difficult thoughts and feelings.Another treatment is cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), either individually or as part of a group. CBT starts with the idea that thoughts, feelings, and behaviour are linked and affect one another. If problems in your life are causing you to binge eat, CBT helps you to reduce bingeing and identify the underlying issues so you’re less likely to binge in the future.As with any antidepressant, an SSRI will usually take several weeks before it starts to work. You’ll usually be started on a low dose, which is then gradually increased as your body adjusts to the medicine.When you start taking an SSRI, see your GP after 2, 4, 6 and 12 weeks to check your progress and to see if you’re responding to the medicine. Not everyone responds well to antidepressant medicines, so it's important your progress is carefully monitored.Very few drugs are recommended for children and young people below the age of 18. It’s also best not to take SSRIs if you have epilepsy or a family history of heart, liver or kidney disease."

These include:depression,anxiety,stress,anger,low self-esteem,feeling dissatisfied with your body and under pressure to be thin,frequently worrying and feeling scared or doubtful about the future,finding it hard to express feelings,experiencing unwanted thoughts, images or urges that make them feel they have to behave in certain ways,Binge eating is often a way of coping with distress, and the above factors can make it harder for someone to cope with distress in a healthy way.Environmental factors are parts of the world around a person, and events happening in their life, that can affect their mental wellbeing in a variety of ways.Stressful life changes – for example, moving house, the breakdown of a relationship, going to college or university, or a bereavement – can make a person more likely to start binge eating as a way of coping.Culture and society may also play a part. People of all ages are exposed to a wide range of media messages promoting the idea that only certain body shapes are desirable, and that not having the ‘ideal’ body is something to be ashamed of. Even health advice that’s intended to be helpful can have a focus on the risks of being overweight, which can add to feelings of pressure and low self-esteem.Other environmental factors that can contribute towards binge eating disorder include:pressure and stress at school, such as exams or bullying – particularly if someone is bullied about body weight or shape,having a family that places high value on body shape, and praises or rewards weight loss,difficult family relationships,stressful or traumatic events in your past,The risk of developing binge eating disorder is thought to be greater in people with a family history of eating disorders. This suggests that genetics could contribute to developing binge eating disorder.As with other mental health conditions, like depression, people with binge eating disorder might have some differences in the way their brains work compared to people who don’t have the condition. These differences may affect the part of the brain that’s linked to appetite and body image."
